<title>David Gallo: Life in the deep oceans</title>
<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With vibrant video clips captured by submarines, David Gallo takes us to some of Earth's darkest, most violent, toxic and beautiful habitats, the valleys and volcanic ridges of the oceans' depths, where life is bizarre, resilient and shockingly abundant.</description>
They do not!
I hope so.
Let's go.
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
The "real you".
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
do you listen to this crap?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
But
Well, no...
I was?
Tons
I believe we share an art instructor
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Sure have.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You got something on your mind?
There.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
That's because it's such a nice one.
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
Let me see what I can do.
That's a shame.
Why?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Great
Who?
You might wanna think about it
Did you change your hair?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Hi, Joey.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
It's more
Patrick -- is that- a.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
You set me up.
So did you
I guess I'll never know, will I?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
Why didn't you tell me?
But
You did what?
As in...
But you hate Joey
Why?
What?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Like you care.
You're welcome.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Can we go now?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
What's normal?
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.
Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Where've you been?
I'm missing something.
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
The prom? Kat has a date?
Because she'll scare them away.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Daddy, no!
It's just a party. Daddy.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, I --
But she doesn't want to date.
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
Just sent 'em through.
Never
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
No, I ' m not.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
It's her favorite band.
Okay! I wasn't sure
Dead at forty-one.
It's a lung cancer issue
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
What makes you think he'll do it?
What about him?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You know French?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Why not?
Who is she?
That girl -- I --
That I'm used to.
How many people go here?
Thirty-two.
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
North, actually. How'd you ?
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
You the new guy?
What's the worst?
She kissed me.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
Then, go get her
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What 're you talking about?
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
What've you got for me?
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Leave my sister alone.
Away.
Not at all
They're running the rest of me next month.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
Do what?
A deal's a deal.
Forget her sister, then.
A hundred bucks a date.
I just upped my price
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You need money to take a girl out
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
You and Verona?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
We're not.
We don't chat.
Are you lost?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Who?
Oh, good. Something new and different for us.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I didn't have a choice.
Who cares?
No fear.
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
That's never been proven
William would never have gone to a state school.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
An attempted slit.
Just a little.
Block E?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Patrick Verona Random skid.
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Because I like to torture you.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.
My grandmother's .
Oh huh
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
No, I won't go with you
No.
Is that a request or a command?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
What?
No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
Tell me something true.
Hearsay.
Fallacy.
For. . . ?
You never disappointed me.
Then you screwed up
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Yes
So what's your excuse?
A soft side? Who knew?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
Maybe.
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Wholesome.
You 're so --
What are you doing here?
No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Who?
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
This.
I should do this.
Then why'd you ask?
Maybe.
Busy
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them. I saw you there.
What?
You know what they say
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I hate him.
Who?
Just let me sit down.
Like you could find one
Why?
You don't care if I die
Why 're you doing this?
This is so patronizing.
I know, just let me sleep
I just need to lie down for awhile
I'm fine. I'm
Funny, you're the only one
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Why, don't you?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
That's what you want, isn't it?

Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Hi
Are you following me?
You -- covered in my vomit.
And why would I do that?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
I know a lot more than that
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Pick you up Friday, then
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
When I go?
No -- impressed.
Bianca did what?
Which parts?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want --
So what I want doesn't matter?
Because you're making decisions for me.
I thought you were punishing me.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Enough!
You decided.
I know.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
Tempestuous?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Yeah...
Right.
Oh yeah.
Yeah. I guess.
Hi.
Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
You were right. She's still pissed.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
What?!
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
What plan?
What?
See you next week!
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
What's to discuss?
+++$+++ I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
+++$+++ I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
I missed you.
Absolutely not.
Your daughters went to the prom.
But -- who -- what --?
Dr. Ruth?
Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Pirate -- no question.
You're not helping.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
In the microwave.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We'll all go crazy...
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Your life, and that of others!
Excellency, you are right.
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
What is it, now? Tell me...
Can't you stay with us a little?
They took everything...
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
You don't usually ask.
That's something you can't decide.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
She said yes.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
Are we going to argue?
I haven't given you much of a life.
I could be gone for years.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
How far from here?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
My letters of appointment.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
May I ask by whom?
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
What does he say?
What are you listening to?
Father...
How are you feeling, Fernando?
I have to explore the mainland.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
There'll be a time.
All of them created by people like me.
What do you see?
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
All I have to do is call the guards.
What...? Do I have so many already?
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You defend yourself admirably...
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
I'm not bargaining!
NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
No...
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
He understands.
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
... and also to bring medicine.
To bring the word of God.
Thousands.
Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Island. Far.
Say not here! Cuba!
Oh? So you are a new man?
I knew you would.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
Give me absolution.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
Colon! Don't!
Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Damn God!
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Father Marchena!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
Esdras is a Jew.
How can you be so certain?
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Why do you wish to sail west?
How did you manage it?
God... That's in a week!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
Do they have such thoughts?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
May I speak freely?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
What did they say about Granada before today?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
You will regret this.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
My horse doesn't work.
We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Twenty eight.
Come over here.
And what do you think Mendez?
God be with us admiral.
You're right. Let the men decide.
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
The land is there. I know it!
You think I don't know that?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Six days ago, yes.
Immediately.
Because he is not afraid of me.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
He must be replaced.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time.
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
Yes, Your Majesty.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Can I see your back?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Give me another one, please.
What else do you need?
Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no.
No. No way.
What's your cut? How much?
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
No, he is here. Shit...
What about Oleg?
I was all of these.
Oh, sure.
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
Where are we going?
He has the camera! He took the movie!
Oh no! No! Shit!
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Daphne, I...
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Pouring it out!
I'll get my clothes.
In the kitchen.
Right.
I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Is he your boyfriend?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone...
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
What are you asking me?
I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What about back home?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
So...the station is empty?
Somewhere else?
Do you live alone? I've been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Are you married?
I will if they don't send me back.
Now I become custody of police department?
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
It was my decision, not his.
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
Chief - mind if I take her?
No! Nothing happened.
I let her take a shower.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Who did cause and origin?
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Yeah, right.
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
No. I'm okay.
Stay with her.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.
Only one guys checked in?
Sorry...PD only.
Any I.D.?
Where is she?
What's he looking for?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
I'm gonna propose.
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
Vodka tonic.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
What are you saying?
Did you tell him you did?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead?
What's wrong?
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Who's there?
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Hey. I'm a professional.
You know what I'm saying here.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
I'm serious here.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Why not?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
You thirsty?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
Two heads.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
I'll let you know what happens.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
You got any better ideas?
Stay here.
You're Polish?
This isn't homicide school.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
What would you call her?
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Pretty.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
Good. Good. Commendable.
Nah, why should you?
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Watch the news?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
You know what that is, right?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
Then do it, asshole.
What's your accomplishment.
What do you want?
Don't be late.
See you later. Good luck.
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Yeah. I promise.
Tonight.
I love you.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
Promise?
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Yeah.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
Answer it.
Answer the phone.
Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
You're ruthless.
You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
I'm not.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Hey.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Eddie, are you okay?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
There are two bodies found at this point.
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Keep them out of my way.
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
Yeah. And he still went to the party.
He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
So what's unique?
How old are your kids?
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
+++$+++ Are you married?
+++$+++ And what do you do with the bones?
+++$+++ You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
+++$+++ Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What? It doesn't work that way.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Where's your partner?
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Look. Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good. You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her. Now why don't you pay me?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don't meet the other girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Where's Czech girl?
He doesn't speak English.
Two weeks.
We are both from Prague.
Is there a problem?
Yes.
+++$+++ Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
+++$+++ How much money are you carrying with you?
+++$+++ What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
+++$+++ Next. Could I see your documents, please?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
In here, says he wants a million.
This all you want?
Who is he?
Traitor!!
No, I don't get that!
Yes. But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Credit?
Your idea? I thought it was my idea.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!'
I'm serious.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous!
Sit down!
What does it look like? It's an address book!
Put the camera down, Oleg.
And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Don't want to film this?
Does it hurt?
Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
You said speak Czech!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
Did you hear what I said?
Don't fool around.
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
We started over, you can too.
It's easy to learn.
Yes, the money is good.
I can get you a job.
Ha. Ha.
Milos. Get my money!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Emil???!
Viewer discretion advised!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her a whiskey.
What are you doing here?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Yeah?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Alright. Go ahead.
I want to hear everything he said.
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
+++$+++ Excuse me?
+++$+++ Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
+++$+++ What are you coming here to do?
+++$+++ Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
+++$+++ Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
+++$+++ Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
He's yours but I take him in! I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
He's my collar!
No way! He's mine!
Evidence. Of a homicide.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
That's what it looks like to me.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this. Now get outta here.
You okay?
I'll send a cop back for you.
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Yeah? What kind?
How did you start the fire this time?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
What the hell happened?
Not good.
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
Aren't you tired?
You hear that question, Garcia?
-- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building? Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Yeah?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no!
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
He knew all along.
But you knew that, right?
Don't blow your nose!
Mouth's clean, too.
Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Oh yeah, why?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
The clerk?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
+++$+++ But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
+++$+++ And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
+++$+++ Permanently disrupted? Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
+++$+++ You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
+++$+++ ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
+++$+++ Your doctor?
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
She's wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
Roger.
I guess not.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
It's the last one.
Hal?
Two more.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
You're kidding.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Good morning. How's it going?
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
That seems very unlikely.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
No. I never did, either.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
It's possible.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Really.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Yes?
What's up?
Sure, what is it?
Okay, come on down.
Right. Just a sec.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Yes, it is.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Well, don't worry about it.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
What is it, Hal?
He's got a point.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Well, what is it?
Did they have any explanation for this?
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
When are you coming home?
Are you coming to my party?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Thank you.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
And your charming little daughter?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Fine.
Yes, very pleasant.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Fortunately, they did.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
That's right.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Really?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Any ideas about the colour?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Opening pod bay doors.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Roger.
Thank you very much, Hal.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true.
True.
I will if I can, Frank.
Great, just great.
How about chargin' the battery?
Yeah, I've been busy.
Hammond.
I want to pick up my car.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place. It's the only thing I know.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Vodka.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Yeah, dummy. Money.
Pros.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I want to drive awhile.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business. As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Here's hoping, baby...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Goodbye.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust. You interested?
In the back. Down the other corridor.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it. Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
You're gonna help us take him.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Would you guys...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is. I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will. He owes me money...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
There's nothin' to talk about.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
You okay?
Partnership?
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Why?
That was quick.
Yeah, I see her.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
You sure that's the reason?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
So you took the rest of the night off...
Let him get some sleep. He's going to need it.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
What about Ganz?
Hello. And goodbye.
Where's luther?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
You stay with me...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Jesus Christ. That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours. I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
What?
Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
Shit.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Yeah. Right.
Right, partner.
Where's the money?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
We split 50-50?
He's after your money.
Just tell me about the money.
Half a million.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
They saved your ass, convict.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Wait a minute. Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us. How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Come on.
There.
You made that move, huh?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
What are you talkin' about?
That's never been one of my problems.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her. She got great tits?
You have a good time?
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population. She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here. If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye. And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Want to try it again?
Hey, this works pretty good.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Shit. I'm already sorry.
No way to start a partnership.
Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
This prison gives out $400 suits?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I got a lot to protect.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here.
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
Didn't work out that way. He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Yeah, I noticed...
You here to write my life story?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass. Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
What a screw-up.
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
I lost them, that's what happened.
I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah?
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Yeah...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Yeah.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls. He was in some bar. .. off duty.
What?
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I'm heading out. How about you?
Nothing.
Doesn't look like it.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
You look awful.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Shit.
I'll help you out.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
When? How?
I don't know.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
That's what I always say.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Three more hours...
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
How do you know?
Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit...
You real down?
I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hi, it's me...
Just a second, that's all!
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Jack, are you okay?
You made the front page.
Great place for lunch.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Call me later.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
What do you want to know? What difference does it make? I'm the guy in your bed the last three months. I make you feel good. You make me feel good. What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Hey, you know what I really think?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I guess he got the message...
What'd you do?
What's wrong with that?
That's the way I see it, too.
Hey, you're right.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
That's no bull.
How would you know?
Shrink major, not a shrink.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Who the hell are you?
Keep stallin'.
Stall.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Shut up.
Sure, right.
Yeah, old times.
Can't complain.
Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
First, the money.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
Surprise, Luther.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
Give it back.
This ain't a credit business.
Five bills.
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Naw, right here's okay.
Not bad, not bad.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
You know exactly where they are!
The case was stolen?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
What're you laughing about?
Corn-i-Lius?
I know...
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life!
No thank you.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
Why? What's wrong with me?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...We're saved!
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
When is she not in trouble?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Good luck..
What kind of mission?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
That's what I thought.
Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
They all like this in your family, father?
So you do know her.
You noticed...
The girl?
Who are you?
That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Thank you, Mr. President.
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
Yes..thank God..
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Where's Leeloo?
I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
They really made her...
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
What's she doing?
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
What is?
They are... with me...
I would like to have died in peace...
I don't have time... I need to know.
Do you love her?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
So, just how big was this fare?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
How many points you got left on your license?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Like shit.
I just found a picture of you.
I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
At least, the cat comes back.
I was talking to the cat.
Hey bud! Finger here.
...Leeloo.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Vito Cornelius?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...'Scuse me?
We will be ready, Lord.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
You little sleaze bag!
...Not yet.
Yeah?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Other than that... You all right?
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Hi Ma...
...Hello?
6... 5...
30 seconds...
I'm sorry..
You have nine points left on your license..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Is that all?
+++$+++ Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
+++$+++ Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
It's like a cab isn't it?
I'll be right back.
Not without Leeloo.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Six to the left. One to the right.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I don't think this is a good time...
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
+++$+++ Crystal.
Uh... not really.
+++$+++ Does it get any better or what!
Oh, yes you will...
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
I thought you were divorced.
What is it?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I'm not going.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I've had enough good news for today
You're the only one left alive...
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Just one... why me?
Where have I heard this song before?
What mission?
I love you...
Because...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
...Like love...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I want to sleep... forever...
I'm so tired...
...The rain falls...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Protect life... Until death.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I'm so very sad.
You're nothing but a... a...
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Where you going?
You noticed..
You get that off the screen?
Here we go again...
Uh...
Apipoussan?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Which one?
Finished what?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Love...
Apipoulai!
Dinoine chagantakat!
Cornelius..
Uh..you're welcome.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Not going to open?
Thanks..
It's not?
Uh..
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
The cash man!
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
This thing solid?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Actually only one cell survived..
How much time is left?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
...What do you mean?
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Gentlemen?
Recommendations.
Options.
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Is that better?
Staedert, do you read me?
Drink!
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
I'm not at the hotel!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
How's our deal coming along?
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
...Not far, now.
Am I disturbing you?
She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
Mrs. Christian.
Amy...
Don't...
I don't know what to say
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I was in hell. If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
You don't understand...
I wanted to call. I couldn't.
You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
Tom...
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
What happened to you?
... What's going on?
What's wrong? Are you alright?
Tom? Where have you been... ?
Hello?
Why the gun?
I know.
I understand.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
I love you.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
How's the detective business?
Okay, I believe you.
I'm not accusing you...
Your clothing reeks of it.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Welcome home.
You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
Snuff?
Anything harder?
What are these?
What the fuck... !
Dino...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
I'm telling you...
The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
+++$+++ How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
+++$+++ Bring the film, or we kill him.
+++$+++ Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
+++$+++ Friend of yours?
+++$+++ You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Look, I don't know what this...
+++$+++ Take out your gun!
+++$+++ Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
+++$+++ Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
+++$+++ They should be here any minute.
+++$+++ Excellent.
+++$+++ You brought the money?
Where's that?
Machine's in?
Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.
I'm camera shy.
I'd rather you didn't.
+++$+++ Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? Very good.
+++$+++ He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
+++$+++ Machine.
+++$+++ I'll consider it.
+++$+++ And they are?
+++$+++ Is it?
Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
+++$+++ Hmm.
+++$+++ Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
+++$+++ What can I do for you today?
+++$+++ You betrayed us.
+++$+++ First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
Fuck off.
You're a dead man.
+++$+++ Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
Is that him?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Any good?
Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
I'm not so sure about this.
Why don't they come to me?
We do.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Call me Tom.
What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
I never killed anyone.
Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
Do it.
Where? Show me where.
Show me where you buried her.
Stop talking.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh? Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world? How you gonna do that... ?
Show me.
What did you do with her body?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Tell me what happened.
You enjoy it?
Because we're going there.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out.
That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
How much did he pay you?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I want his name.
Who is Machine?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Don't ask questions.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had...
You killed that girl and you put it on film. You and your pals, you're fucked. You fucked up real good.
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Eddie.
Fuck you!
Look, you cocksucker...
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.
He's lying.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
You almost went over your limit.
Enlighten me.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
I'm asking.
Just tell me. Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up? Tell me, because I really want to understand. Did he jerk off to it? You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers.
They're no friends of mine.
Never mind how I found you.
I was well compensated.
That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
You are a private investigator?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
What's this?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's next?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
You don't need to be here.
Who is he, his name?
Who is he?
Wha... ?
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
It's their Presidential Suite.
See ya.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Where does he sell it?
Specialty product.
A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
Good question.
A daughter.
What about me?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Where are your parents?
How old are you?
What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
Snuff films.
Child pornography.
Interesting theory.
Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
See you then. Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
How much do you make now?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Not quite.
I'm not a cop.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now.
Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
How long you been working there?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
Remember me?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Truman Capote.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Big date tonight?
+++$+++ How will I get it to you?
+++$+++ Fine...
+++$+++ Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
+++$+++ I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
+++$+++ How are you? Having any luck?
+++$+++ Hello?
+++$+++ You told me to look, so I looked.
+++$+++ Okay.
+++$+++ Do you think the film could have cost that much?
+++$+++ Hello... ?
You're joking.
Okay, I follow you so far...
+++$+++ The checks were for odd amounts...
+++$+++ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
+++$+++ I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.
+++$+++ You've found missing persons before.
+++$+++ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
+++$+++ No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
+++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
+++$+++ I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
I'm afraid I don't...
+++$+++ Cash, stock certificates, and this...
+++$+++ There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...
+++$+++ My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
+++$+++ We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply.
+++$+++ Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
My condolences.
+++$+++ You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
+++$+++ I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
He's odd.
+++$+++ Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Uh huh, pleasure.
+++$+++ Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
+++$+++ Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
+++$+++ No... no... no...
+++$+++ No...
+++$+++ Who are you?
+++$+++ Who is this... ?
+++$+++ What... ?
+++$+++ What are you talking about... ?
+++$+++ I remember. You just left...
+++$+++ Hello... ?
It's been six years.
+++$+++ Yes.
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?
Will you let me look?
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...
Do you think the police did a good job?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
No.
We're all like that.
+++$+++ Okay.
Of course.
+++$+++ No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
+++$+++ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
+++$+++ There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
+++$+++ It got to be too much for him.
+++$+++ We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ I don't know.
+++$+++ She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.
+++$+++ No.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
That's exactly what I am.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
+++$+++ Yes... ?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back. After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things. Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Those are her belongings.
I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents.
Yes. I remember her.
Yes... I remember Mary
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
None too discreet, is he?
Certainly, sir.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
No, you may not.
Cash.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out. The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep. Not while he's using me.
I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen...
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
You alright?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Alice, you think you can leave?
Rick...I can't.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
I don't want to.
What?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
I'm sure they're around.
Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you.
Then you saw him, too?
You've been up all night?
We have matching luggage.
I know.
I know. I hardly have any time to study.
You in a hurry?
You look great!
What the hell was that?
Here we are.
He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
You just feel sorry for me.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Is there something we can do?
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy. Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me. Someone to bring them to him.
Three days.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
I've been working double shifts.
No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful...
I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
You're his sister, right?
I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in...
It was Freddy.
Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Been up with Alice.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Nice neighborhood.
So?
So what's up? What'd I miss?
I don't get it.
Hey, Rick!
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
I'm sorry honey, but...
What's wrong with me?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
What is it?
What?
Something wrong with the stairs?
You don't get it, he's after me...
I gotta get out of here.
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
You're not taking my baby!
What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
+++$+++ And ours. It's our grandchild.
What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
It's okay, Dan
He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
My friend, with the funny hand.
Who said I...wait, what?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true. I'll bet she's very worried about you. I would be.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Is that who you're waiting for?
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
How did you know that?
My name is...
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hey...wake up.
There you go. Love you.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
About him?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
I know.
The tickets.
Jesus! Don't do that!
+++$+++ Now.
+++$+++ No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
+++$+++ Alice!
You disappointed in me?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Very funny.
How was the meeting?
+++$+++ I'm so sorry, honey...
+++$+++ You sure you don't want a ride to work?
To take a picture.
+++$+++ It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
+++$+++ No. A deal's a deal.
+++$+++ I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's okay. He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
So did Dan.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body. Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me. It must be!
Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.
What do you think I'm doing? Look. Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back. He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Krueger is reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward. I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
I don't understand.
Poor woman...
But I've seen her grave.
Meaning?
No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
They think I'm nuts.
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Where are you going?
Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
My baby!
Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
It wasn't her mother. The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Nobody thinks that.
Mark!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
Yeah. I'm just aces.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Well we gotta do something!
Greta, come on. One burger with me?
I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
Next life. Oh, what's that?
All of us. Right?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
I want to talk about the baby.
Nah. It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair. She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Yeah...
Makes you look like a nun--
He invited me to his house last night.
Stick around, please?
I can't listen to this.
Mark...
Faint.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
And his 'egghead' son! We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
I don't know.
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Yes?
I'd sooner swim!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
You may not <u>win</u> them. But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
<u>You</u> said it. But I won't argue -
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow. We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your 'out.' This came for you.
Not in two days. Look: Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come? If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
How is he - ?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
Dave - !
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Well?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
You hear that?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
I don't hear anything. Maybe you've been down here too long. Why don't you go back up and -
Yeah?
I think you're right.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
'Us?'
Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son! It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
Huh?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
So they caught up with you, too?
Helen. I appeal to you -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating - What do you think of this husband of yours? On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer. But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
The frogmen?
Right at our one-eyed friend!
What???
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
I...don't know!
Seems to be all around...
Right, Skipper.
What????
Why do you say that?
Something wrong?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Excuse me, Skipper---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Now they feel it...down below.
Wonderful!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
+++$+++ There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
+++$+++ As we near the Pole...
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
+++$+++ ....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... ...'recharging his batteries'?
+++$+++ <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force. Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
+++$+++ What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit? Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
+++$+++ ...above Murmansk, and Finland.
+++$+++ Under <u>water</u>?
Minus three.
Nothing we can do, now.
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
We can <u>ram</u> him!
That's what I said!
Thirty-four seconds!
Take a look.
After torpedo room: Report!
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
It'll be all right. We're old friends!
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Who with?
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
+++$+++ Obviously.
+++$+++ Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
+++$+++ It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Why?
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
He did!
Swell!
+++$+++ My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
+++$+++ Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Come where?
All right - go to it.
+++$+++ Toward the Pole!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
+++$+++ Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
+++$+++ I'll be another!
+++$+++ The pattern. Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole. A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
+++$+++ Thank you.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
No.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
No. Black.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Tell me.
Yeah. I know about that.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Same old shit.
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter. I'll send you the five hundred.
Oh.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Yes.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
This spring.
I plan to. Soon.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
We bought you.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
He's on to us!
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
You see it?
I hear Twombley got shot.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Deers have ears too.
This way.
Safety on?
What happened?
Hmm.
Really.
Oh.
You played for the Sox?
Yeah?
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Wonderful!
I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Mmm.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You might not kill it.
If you get it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
Open the door. We're late.
Open the door, will ya?
Lawford?
He sure as hell won't.
Yeah.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
What?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
What blood?
Yeah.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
In the chest.
Piece of fucking cake.
Shit.
Right!
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Don't mind if I do.
I want to go home.
Oh.
You're a policeman.
That's illegal, you know.
I want to go home.
What are you sorry for?
Fine.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
What do you want, then?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
How about a Big Mac?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
It belongs to Pop.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
I called Mommy.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
No.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
It's fun.
What then?
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
What are you talking about?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
To us it was.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I guess they're stupid.
Break stuff?
Do what?
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Those are the Hoyts.
Yeah.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
The key, Wade.
Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
Could be.
Maybe.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
So?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
How you holding up, Wade?
Yeah. A few things.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
I figured you already heard.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Don't go playing policeman.
Huh?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
No problem. Look, I...
See. Get your boots.
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
It's just...
We should talk.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Yeah.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Where's Jill?
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Mel Gordon.
I know who it is.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Wade.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Of course! I would've heard.
Strange.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I know your parents.
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Alright. I'll think about it.
You've been married twice --
Oh, Wade.
Then... I guess you have to.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Money.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Okay.
Call me.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
You don't mean that.
I'm sorry.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm sorry about what I said.
You okay?
You okay?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
Okay. She's fine.
For a while.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
It makes me sad.
When did she die?
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
You're not using it today?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
How's that?
+++$+++ Can't it wait, then?
+++$+++ Something about my father?
+++$+++ Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
+++$+++ He's asleep. We were up very late.
+++$+++ Who are you?
He got his deer yet?
His office. You mean my old office.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. I gotta go.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Jack?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Marg! You got orders!
Marg!
This town sucks.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
What?
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Crawl!
You and me.
Yeah.
Call it what you want.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
In the living room.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
She's coming.
Yeah.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Nothing.
Atta-go.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day. Sally, turn off that TV!
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
For what?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Money.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
That it wasn't an accident.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Want to know what I think happened?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
What about her?
Yeah. I forgot.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Get some sleep.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
What happened?
Who?
How was she?
Huh?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
You think Jack shot him?
Twombley.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Rolfe.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Yes dear?
Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
That's not really the point.
I know... But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I'm sorry, honey.
I know, Mom. It was great... really.
Back at The Fishbowl?
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
I'm sure he's busy.
Yeah, no duh.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
He didn't leave us.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
I don't drink coffee.
There they are!
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
How you doing, sweetie?
Daddy...
Alice!
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Hey, you guys back already?
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Did we warn them off?
+++$+++ cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
+++$+++ Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
+++$+++ Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
+++$+++ Do you see the maintenance panel?
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
+++$+++ Lemme take a look.
+++$+++ Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
+++$+++ We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
+++$+++ Stay cool.
+++$+++ Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
I'm doing what I can.
He's busy being dead.
You read my mind.
+++$+++ Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
+++$+++ That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
+++$+++ They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
+++$+++ They aren't answering their hails.
+++$+++ Walter, if you have a point, make it.
We don't know that.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls.
Thanks. Wrote it last night.
Goddamn right I did. I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
+++$+++ To swear you in as President.
+++$+++ If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
+++$+++ If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
+++$+++ They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
+++$+++ I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
+++$+++ We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
+++$+++ Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
My loyalty was never to my country.
Because it is my duty.
Yes, Mr. President.
+++$+++ Ga get it.
Roger.
Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
About goddamn time.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe. The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and... refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Where are we now?
We're not going to make it.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
How?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Any of us?
How many others killed?
The rest of the secret service?
We've already been inspected.
+++$+++ This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs. Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One. This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
+++$+++ We copy. Stand by... Tower?
+++$+++ Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Scared. We're scared.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Thank you.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
You don't know the half of it. Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Jim...
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Say something dear.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
That was war.
How can you? I mean they're people.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Do you have to be so brutal?
My husband is a very courageous man.
What do you know of my husband?
Leave my daughter alone.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you want with us?
Hold on, Alice.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
There goes your ride.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Stop.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Over my dead body.
+++$+++ I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
+++$+++ Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
+++$+++ You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.
+++$+++ Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
That isn't necessary.
+++$+++ Yes, sir.
Got it.
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
+++$+++ We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
+++$+++ Gravity.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
They've gotta be joking.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
What are you doing?
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
I don't know why you stayed.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
How did your speech go?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
I wish it were that easy...
I miss you. And I miss her.
You know what?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world's leaks. Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
Can't it wait?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
White House Situation room.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
The fax machines.
The fax machines.
+++$+++ Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
Did they say anything about my family?
But...
AGENT +++$+++ We're handling it, sir.
AGENT +++$+++ We're under attack.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
This is the President.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Twenty-five years.
Shit.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Shepherd.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.
You give me ulcers.
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you... I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
I might still have a few chips left.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
You wanna knock of f?
* CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
I was reading too.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur. He's got a lunar flight today. I want him pulled. Jacobs, pull Oveur!
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
That's right, Commissioner. Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
What?
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner? Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What is it, Mary?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Did you feel that?
Sir?
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
You better check it, Unger.
Accelerators down.
Dunn.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Compute!
Set!
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Are you afraid?
What will happen to him, Ted?
You mean...
Simon just ejected!
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That was very well put, Ted.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Elaine, I'm going back there. Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine!
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted. This ship should never have passed FSA inspection. This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Let me by, Elaine.
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick. Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time. And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Elaine.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Ted, what's wrong?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
I mean for Ted.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder. Let me show you. Ted's problem is in this area. This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Simon, what are you saying?!
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.
My career is shot.
Can't we change course?
Simon, what's happening?!
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
I think so.
Don't be too long.
So mentally ill?
Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
I guess this is a first for you.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon. I'm a very lucky woman.
Simon.
Roger. You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Roger.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
Yes, sir.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me. We can be alone. I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Life support check. Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me. You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Systems check positive. Look, Elaine, I...
You have great tits.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's not possible.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
He's a boy dog.
Can I hold him?
Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
All right. Here.
I don't want to hear that word!
We've spent everything on these operations. Is it really worth it? We've pawned your mother's wedding ring. The kids have no winter clothes...
I'm sure.
That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids. You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
Just poached on toast. Over.
No. Poached. Over.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary. Over.
What should I say?
A b...
Sixteen 'C', why?
Yes, sir, commander. This is Mercury One. Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Captain Oveur?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You folks need any help?
Don't try to stop me!
Death, death. How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Pull yourself together! We've got to...
Then Elaine was right.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No, I mean your head. Sit down. I'll take a look at it. I'm a nurse.
You've been hurt.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
No. I'm all alone.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Ah, won't you sit down?
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
+++$+++ Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
George Zipp said that?
Surely there must be something you can do.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Surely you can't be serious.
Both pilots!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
+++$+++ You can't take a guess for another two hours?
+++$+++ Can't you take a guess?
+++$+++ Captain, how soon can we land?
No. No one that I know of.
+++$+++ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
+++$+++ Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
+++$+++ Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
He had fish.
+++$+++ Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
+++$+++ What was it we had for dinner tonight?
+++$+++ It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
+++$+++ You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
See them, Elaine?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Yes?
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Rats! I've lost number three.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
What's his problem?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Headquarters!? What is it?
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
I love you, Elaine.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Ted, what are you doing here?
But if you'll just give me...
You expect me to believe that?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine!
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Who wants to be first?
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hello.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Good-bye, darling.
You promise you'll write.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Yes, Captain?
Here.
How ya doing, honey?
Oh, I can't stand it.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I'm Randy.
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes?
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Roger.
Roger.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Excuse me, Sister?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
The cockpit? What is it?
No. No thank you.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Thank you.
Yeah...
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out. A little scared... and a lot curious. Maybe more than you want to admit. But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together? Think of it as broadening your horizons.
A virgin. I find that very arousing...
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right? Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
You've got me all wrong. I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Oooh. Hardball. That sounds interesting. Are you going to strike me? You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
In there.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Ss'ai k'ss? Perfect.
That's right.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Look at your dildo partner. He's too scared to even come down to the sand. You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
You don't have squat.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Sergeant... Detective. I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Yes...
Do it!
Kill them both.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
He didn't recognize me.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
How do I look?
But there's no more drug.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
No he's not. Not if he overdosed on the drug. Massive amounts trigger a... a change. Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation. When you emerge you're...
... It's Harcourt.
Do what?! George-- ?!
There! Go back. Down that side street.
It'd be for your own good. I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book. ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going. I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
Ss-ai!
Fuck procedure.
Why? What's the big goddamn deal?
George, c'mon -- lighten up. It's a beauty of a case. Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
Uh, George...
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot stop this without you.
Your people don't know about this part of out past. And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
No... I am sure not. That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here. But none of my people know how to make it. The process was carefully guarded.
We all did.
Like your cocaine, I suppose. The "high" lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
... It is called ss'jabroka'. To us it is a potent narcotic.
No. I cannot involve you. This is not your concern.
You must leave me alone on this.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. So what the hell's the connection?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
What was that about?
It's all right, George. It's cool. Just wait here, all right? I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Why?
Come on, let's go, dude. Surf's up!
Well, let's roll, George.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car. I didn't get a good look at him. I must call my wife...
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?
Don't count on me, George. I never had any ideals.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before. You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality. You aspire to very high ideals here.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Your health...
In the other man's rectum.
Maybe not... I don't know. I'm not sure I'm gonna go. She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
I appreciate your honesty, George.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed. It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Was. Divorced.
Yeah... I know the routine.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
I believe he is probably lying.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Who is he?
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Ss'loka'. It means literally "small but intelligent creature". It loses much in the translation.
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
This is mole. It's good.
Three months. We learn quickly. We adapt. It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Yeah, sure. I knew that...
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room. The selection process was entirely random. We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.
Stay back! I'm okay.
That's very colorful. But see -- now I've got a problem. I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter. So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Tell me.
Screw you.
But I-- .
Uh, Matthew...
At the end of the bar.
My partner is dead! Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Why'd I do what?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
A week ago two men came to see her husband. After they left, he was very frightened. She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her. It was Hubley.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
Get the picture?
What is this?
Nothing?
What's this? What's going on?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Well... yes, quite possibly.
What is wrong?
Yes.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case. The Captain said--
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Nice signal, dickwad!
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Let's talk Hubley.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right? Whatta you care?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
I am George.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
No... two.
Only holds five.
What is it?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Who else can I ask around here?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Sure. Just a minute.
I'm sorry, Matt. Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Released December one. He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April. Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering. He and his wife have one child, a son.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
That's all I know. You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah... I seen him around. High- roller dude named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side. Encounters.
What's that?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again-- Is your name Porter?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.
Yeah, I'll bet.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough. Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
The human?
Come on. You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Don't tell me what to think.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Departmental policy.
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
I'll cover you! Get outta there!!
Get outta there!
Watch the driver. I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay? But--
What?
How can I go?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Position?
Rescue mission. There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Let's go...let's go. Cycle through!
Would you, Sir?
This floor's freezing.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Flame-units only. I want rifles slung.
First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast. Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Okay, let's do it.
...that's better. Pan it around a bit.
You did okay, Bishop.
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
HOW MUCH TIME?
It's going to be closer. You better get going.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
I'll go.
And it's too late to shut it down?
How long until it blows?
Hard to say. It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. That's if she exists, of course.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society.
That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Yes. That follows.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Sorry to disappoint you.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me. Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You son of a bitch.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. Let's move cautiously. First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
She's right.
Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
That's the plan. My word on it.
Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi...
Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo. And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. You gotta get back on the horse...
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it.
No. There's no way!
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry.
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody. We can't have any firing in there.
PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
It's insured.
Dead on all channels.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
Forget it.
How do you feel?
I told them to fall back...
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW!
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Proceed inside.
What is it?
Where are your parents? You have to try...
One of us?
Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
We're not making that out too well. What is it?
Alive?
Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go.
He's coming in. I feel safer already.
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line. Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Are there any questions? Hudson?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
Sir?
Fuckin' A!
Six meters. Five. What the fu --
Let's get these things lit.
Do it!
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Aye-firmative.
Are you finished? You okay?
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Sure, Hicks.
Don't be long, Ellen.
We ain't going anywhere.
All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now!
Stand back.
We didn't miss anything.
Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations.
Let's waste him. No offense.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Yeah. I've noticed.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Maybe. Maybe not.
But they don't know that. They're probably looking for other ways to get in. That'll take them awhile.
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
On my way.
That's right. So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... ...and seal these ducts here and here. Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
All right. There's a fire door at this end. The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Removed surgically before embryo implantation. Subject: Marachuk, John L. Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off.
You're just reading me.
Hudson, give us a break.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Anytime. Anywhere.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Can't be. That's inside the room!
They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct. Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Seal the door.
Just get back here!
What do you mean, they cut the power? How could they cut the power, man? They're animals.
Oh, right! Right! With those things running around. No way.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Thanks.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours! Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Looks like it stung him.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
So what do I tell this guy?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team. Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Terrible.
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
That's right.
Right here, baby. Right here.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight.
Newt, wait!
Sure. Go left.
Come on. Crawl faster.
Burke! Open the door!
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Wah...? Where are...?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt. And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
You mean dead.
Where is she?
Did you ever have a baby?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Why do they tell little kids that?
My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted.
I'm sorry, Newt.
You're really something, ace.
The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
And hope to die?
You promise?
They're dead.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
I don't want you for a friend.
Casey. She's my only friend.
What did you say?
+++$+++ Sixty, maybe seventy families.
What are you talking about. What people?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
+++$+++ Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be...
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! Like I said.
+++$+++ It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
What do you mean?
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Extremely clever.
You were sublime.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
The marriage!
Did you know? Had you heard?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
You might be disappointed.
Perhaps.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
A Turkish brothel.
A brothel.
In a harem.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
No.
Yes.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Good morning.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Is she a good fuck?
No, she's fine.
Oh - excuse me!
Don't bother.
Don't bother!
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Sir -
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Yes!
I want to go back to Vienna.
I want to go!
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
It's killing me.
I can't write it!
Give me two more weeks. Please.
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
No. Don't answer it!
Why not?
What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
No one.
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
You're not going to do this?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
What?
Salzburg. We were just talking about Salzburg. If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Yes, my love?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.
Stanzi!
Oh, damn!
Well, ask her!
What does she want?
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Wolfi!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
I love you! I love you!
No!
Tell them to go!
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Yes!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Yes.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Em iram! Em iram!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Why? People fart backwards.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Fartsbishop!
Where?
No! No! No!
Stop it!
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
And I'm asking you -
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Why you?
What are you doing here?
What?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
What do you mean?
What for?
Tonight?
Oh, thank you, sir!
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Yes.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
No, sir. This is my own idea.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I understand.
How charming. But why did he not come himself?
Frau Mozart?
Excellency!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Not at all.
Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Do you hear him? Do you?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
In three months! Papa.
Oh, yes.
+++$+++ Behold!
+++$+++ Hey!
+++$+++ Behold!
+++$+++ Adorable!
+++$+++ Be careful!
+++$+++ Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
+++$+++ Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
+++$+++ Do you know who I am? This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
+++$+++ Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
+++$+++ What a strange young man.
I said play!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Gertrude!
+++$+++ You can't be Herr Mozart!
+++$+++ Upstairs.
+++$+++ I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
+++$+++ Just one year.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
+++$+++ Ah, now! Here she comes.
Well, look at them.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Yes?
Really?
Of course not.
Oh?
Why not?
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Sire.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Ah-ha!
Let's have some fun. Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
May I try it?
What a charming idea. May I see?
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on. On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Yes, Sire.
Ah! By all means.
What is it?
Thank you, Sire!
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
What do you mean, Sire?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
And German?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
What? On one hearing only?
Ah-ha.
Yes, where?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Why so?
Majesty!
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
Yes, what about him?
Well, what do you have for me today?
+++$+++ Yes, sir.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
+++$+++ I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Are you playing a trick on me?
Papa, is this your idea?
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
No, really!
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
It's a secret.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
This one will.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Yes.
Pupils?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
It couldn't be better.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Do you always live like this?
Is she not here?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Why are you here?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I don't know. He has pains.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
In there, sir.
Yes what?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Do any pupils come to the house?
Bene.
Bene! Bene!
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Good morning, sir.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Are you Herr Mozart?
So let me see it. Where is it?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Why not?
Can I see it?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What is this?
Wolfi!
So there you are. What do you say?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Animals?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
I liked the horse.
Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Sssh! Stay here.
Sssh!
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
I am so ashamed.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Do you want to rest a bit?
Yes.
You go fast!
Yes!
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Show me.
Do you have me?
And that's all?
Also identical?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Please! Just one moment.
Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
I think so.
Yes.
Common time.
The Fire.
Yes.
Confutatis Maledictis.
Strange!
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Do you believe in it?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Where did I stop?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Of course.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
He knows. He knows!
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
The man. He's here.
No! No, it's him!
I'm too young to be so sick.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Do you mean that?
This is only a vaudeville.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
What happened? Is it over?
Are you neglecting my request?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
How much?
Who are you?
What dead? Who is dead?
What work?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
I never knew that music like that was possible.
How could it not, Excellency?
How could I not?
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
But what is it they don't like?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
With all my heart, Mozart.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
How fortunate.
You burned the score?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Really? Why?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
I can't say. Really
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Ah. Italian?
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Do you have a daughter?
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Whom did they choose?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Did you like it, then?
But this is absurd!
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Mio caro Adone.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What are you doing, Herr Director?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
But, Your Majesty -
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
Exactly.
I think you'd better.
Oh? Have I seen it?
+++$+++ Herr Mozart -
+++$+++ Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
+++$+++ Mozart -
+++$+++ Mozart -
+++$+++ Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
+++$+++ A little modesty would suit you better.
+++$+++ Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
+++$+++ On the contrary.
+++$+++ Because His Majesty wishes it.
+++$+++ What is what?
+++$+++ Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
+++$+++ Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish? Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
+++$+++ Mozart -
+++$+++ Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
+++$+++ My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
+++$+++ I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Oh my son, my poor son!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
But not his body.
No, you didn't!
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Yes.
What?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
My son, no one can speak for God.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
You cannot say that!
+++$+++ Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
+++$+++ It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Do you hear me?
+++$+++ Do you believe it?
+++$+++ And do they believe it?
+++$+++ Ah - you've heard that?
+++$+++ I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
+++$+++ Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
+++$+++ Well?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Here in Vienna.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
In the sight of God that is a sin.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Yes, in the third act.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
About the ballet.
The Emperor has given him permission.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Where?
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes.
Exactly.
Italian?
Yes?
+++$+++ Ah.
+++$+++ Oh yes, yes. And that was?
+++$+++ I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
What do you mean - now?
I can't wait.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
What? Who the devil are you?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
I agree, Baron.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
What does he want?
That lady is back, sir.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
I'll call tomorrow.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
But he's all right?
Can we come in?
Herr Salieri.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
The American? Yes, duck.
+++$+++ I doubt it. But it's something to do.
+++$+++ Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
What shall we do?
No, a cab will be faster.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, I should think so.
No, not really.
No, why?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He's here.
What shall we do?
Dr. Hirsch?
Surely you're not suggesting...
+++$+++ You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
And what else?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Yes.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
He's not?
+++$+++ It's a full moon. Where is he?
+++$+++ Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
+++$+++ Did he say a wolf?
+++$+++ The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
+++$+++ That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
+++$+++ What exactly did he call out?
+++$+++ Oh, Miss Price?
+++$+++ Go about your duties.
+++$+++ Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
David, don't lose control.
David, let's go now.
Will you shut up!?!!
I swear, I don't know this girl.
What?
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Pull over.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
I should be committed.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
I've left those pills for you.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Anything.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
But, David.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Of course.
Yes?
It's nice to see you.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
The bedroom.
Bathroom.
Closet.
The kitchen.
I would think so.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Your dead friend Jack?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Are you better now?
I'm a werewolf.
Now I'm embarrassed.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Not just a patient -- me.
Will you think about it?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you come with me?
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Shall I read to you?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I know.
Twenty-eight.
That's not really a very proper question.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I dream of death mostly.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I thought you were asleep.
Will you give me a break?
Right.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Call me Alex.
Sorry.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Mr. Kessler?
What?
I beg your pardon?
I thought not.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No what?
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Why on earth do you say that?
Chart says he's from New York.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Who is this girl?
Now see here young man.
There's no call for that kind of language.
All right, you two, move along.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
You could have told them!
That's very funny, that is.
+++$+++ No. You've had your chance.
+++$+++ All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
+++$+++ You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
+++$+++ Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
What are you going to see?
Alex?
What time is it?
I was having a nightmare.
+++$+++ Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
+++$+++ Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
+++$+++ David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
+++$+++ I really don't know.
+++$+++ No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
+++$+++ You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
+++$+++ You've never had bad dreams before?
+++$+++ In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
+++$+++ So they said.
+++$+++ Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
+++$+++ You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
+++$+++ You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
+++$+++ Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
+++$+++ I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
+++$+++ You're in a hospital in London.
+++$+++ Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
I could hang myself.
Because this must be stopped.
Hello.
I want you to meet some people.
What about the zoo?
Thank you.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You don't have to say anything.
Hi, David.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Jack, are you really dead?
A monster. I know, I know.
Get out of here, Jack!
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
What are you doing here?
You're not real.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Nurse!
Nurse!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Stop it, Jack.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
What?!
Will you be quiet?!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Shut up, you zombie!
I'm not listening!
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
What?!
I'm going completely crazy.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I can't stand it.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Thanks a lot.
Nice to see you.
You really scared me, you shithead.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Yeah.
Not far enough. Come on.
No.
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Oh shit. What is that?
It's in front of us.
Plan?
It's circling us.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
I don't know. Come on.
Yeah.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Pecos Bill.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Yeah?
What was it?
Did you hear that?
Say, David...
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
What do you think was wrong?
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Apparently so.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
You ask them.
Wrong.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
You ask them.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
What about it?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Nice to see you.
Shall we?
I assume full responsibility.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
You're talking about the woman I love.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
David.
Good.
Are you cold?
+++$+++ What can we do to assist you?
+++$+++ The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
+++$+++ Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
+++$+++ Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
+++$+++ Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
+++$+++ Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
+++$+++ What here?
+++$+++ Excuse me. Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
+++$+++ I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
+++$+++ What's that?
Sorry, love.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Remember the Alamo?
Oh.
Then you have some hot tea?
Hot chocolate?
Do you have any hot soup?
+++$+++ I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
+++$+++ I don't rightly know, sir.
+++$+++ Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
+++$+++ He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
+++$+++ Sorry.
+++$+++ No, thank you.
Yes - sure—
Why not?
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with. Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
I want to know why .
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Hello, Tom.
He has?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Where's Matt?
No kidding?
Oscar, what's the matter?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
I remember once when your account checked.
What's the matter, Charlie?
Where you been?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Whose death?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Charlie!
Let me have ten bucks?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
And tell him not to delay.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What good will that do?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you? Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
What about?
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years? I'll tell you. Not a single one! What's wrong with that kind of banking?
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . . You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Why, of course.
Oh!
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Fifty thousand dollars!
What happened? You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
know, but—
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
What do you mean?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
I haven't got it.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
What are you doing here?
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
+++$+++ What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
+++$+++ You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
+++$+++ No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals— I think I will have a drink.
+++$+++ No. I know the answer to that one. I think you'd better take me home.
+++$+++ I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
+++$+++ What's this?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I want to be near you!
Don't you know?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Well—
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
+++$+++ See, we're getting along famously!
+++$+++ Doesn't that come next?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
+++$+++ Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
+++$+++ Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
+++$+++ —running around. Not your work. You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
+++$+++ Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
Well, you can. You always could.
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Why, I needed a—
I guess I have said enough I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
No? Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it. You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Now?
Yes, sir.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Thank you!
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Excuse me—
Much better this morning, thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Happy now?
+++$+++ Tomorrow night?
+++$+++ Well . . .
+++$+++ Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
+++$+++ The girls! I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
+++$+++ Yes, of course.
+++$+++ The theatre?
+++$+++ I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
+++$+++ Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Oh!
Good morning.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Yes, sir.
Now don't you worry about it.
Where is he now?
Yes, sir.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Helen!
+++$+++ Mr. Sampson . . .
+++$+++ Yes, sir.
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
+++$+++ Mr. Dickson?
+++$+++ Yes, thank you.
+++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
You haven't got a uniform?
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
But I haven't . . .
All right. That's all. Please, Matt.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night? Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
You're protecting somebody.
I can't tell you.
There you are.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
It's all right. Thanks.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances. Why, this kid's got a record.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
If he can do it, yes.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
Yes.
Why pick on him ?
What's the matter? What's going on here? This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
What'll we do?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Yes, sir.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
What are you talking about?
Yes, sir.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right. Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Absolutely.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
+++$+++ Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
+++$+++ Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
+++$+++ Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
+++$+++ Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
+++$+++ Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Mr. Williams . . .
Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
They must have turned him down.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Oh, Matt . . .
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
What's keeping you?
In Cluett's office?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Well . . . ?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Oh, ten dollars—
With what?
Oh, is that so?
Come here, honey!
Matt, come here!
Yes, sir.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He was in the bank yesterday.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Dude Finlay?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
What did you find out, Mike?
+++$+++ Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
+++$+++ No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
+++$+++ No. It wasn't earlier because...
+++$+++ Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
+++$+++ That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
+++$+++ Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
+++$+++ Huh?
+++$+++ It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
+++$+++ —for the rheumatism, you know.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
What time did you get in?
So you were home last night?
Then who changed it?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
wasn't anywhere near this place—
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
I guess so.
Bought himself a pocketbook!
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
I'm okay, Matt.
Okay, Matt.
Now you tell us.
This is healing?
+++$+++ I couldn't lose him.
+++$+++ I think I may just go on to the reservation.
You can ride like that?
He's not bad at it.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Swear.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
What have you done?
Leave me alone, Bob.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
What?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
Uhh, yeah it does.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
That was two hours ago.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Never a good thing.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Tomorrow.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
He just lost his temper a little.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Nope.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Tell me.
What?
He's been full of vinegar lately.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. You explain it to him.
Exactly.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Two.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
I think I recognize you.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Missed you too, cousin.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
I'm out.
Pass me some whisky.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
A trap.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin. Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
And I'm the better outlaw.
That's it.
I got us through the War all right.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
You're forgetting who's in charge --
What are you saying?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Yep.
Sure, cousin.
Twenty?!
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
I got three.
Don't let it happen again.
The James-Younger Gang.
Perfect, Cole.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
Because we were good at it? Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
It was exciting.
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
She had a moustache.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
What is wrong with you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Where you boys going?
I could use the walk.
What's going on?
+++$+++ I'm thinking...
+++$+++ Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
+++$+++ You ride like a Comanche.
+++$+++ You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
They're just insurance in case we run.
Another dozen out back.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Shakespeare. He's European.
Sadie was not a man!
The brown one.
I think one of 'em's glass.
What the --
Both would be nice.
All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk...
This here is the Younger Gang!
What?
The safe. Now.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Of St. Louis?
+++$+++ Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
+++$+++ You 'um big lawman?
+++$+++ Fine. I'll just wait here.
+++$+++ Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
+++$+++ Then why can't I go in there?
+++$+++ I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
I had you covered. From back there.
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What the --
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. But out.
+++$+++ Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Go home, Doc. They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Died a hero.
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
+++$+++ Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
+++$+++ They're gone. What are you --
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Daddy, don't start with this again.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Yeah.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Jim was old enough...
Got any ideas, little brother?
No, I --
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
We're drunk.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
We're doing this for Ma.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
You've killed your fair share of men.
And we're good at it.
This has been a good year.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Bob's upset.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
We're gonna have to talk...
How'd it go in there?
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
What do you think?
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Heard of him.
Your Zee? Hmm. "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
You are a charmer.
"Big and older"?
That just might work.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Hell of a war.
Web's dead.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
That would have made an impression.
Such as?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Distracting enough for you?
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
How much of that story is true?
Uncle Frank?
So what was he?
But he killed a lot of men, too.
They're making him a hero now.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Shush.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Riders --
Ma! Please!
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Easterners.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
A fair number, Ma.
I'll explain on the way.
Yes ma'am.
You are a hell of a woman.
Yes ma'am.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Don't turn around.
Stop it. This is just sad.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Oh, I'm not finished. "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple." As I said. Hmm.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Hmm.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
Zee.
Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop?
Let the law --
You and I, we've started... something, you know? I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Sparkling rocks?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Not if I find the right girl.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
You're sick of my company?
You shouldn't be up.
Jesse, is that your hand?
Jesse, are you awake?
But still died.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Fair enough.
Thanks.
He's too important, James. They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
No, I'll hang you. But I may miss you just a bit.
You cocky little bastard.
That's what I would have done.
Was it worth it?
Oh. That's nice to know. We're going to hang you, you know.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Damn.
Yes?
Mmm.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
You almost ended my career before it began.
Did you order our houses burned down?
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
But I like the presidential suite.
Communion.
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
This time we'll make an exception.
It's his money. He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
You do that.
I swear.
I think so.
You been with a girl ever?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
You okay, Jesse?
I like that.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Don't talk about it much, though.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Not at all.
Really?
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Why, yeah.
There's only four of them...
How can that be?
They had to be dealt with!
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
I remember you.
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
What, sir?
Sir?
I look forward to seeing it.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
What is going on here, man?
We did.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Yes sir.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Really!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
What the hell is that sound?
What is that?
Can you put men at all four?
In English, Pinkerton.
No.
It's going to be a long spring.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
I can't believe this.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
It's going to be a long winter.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!" Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
This is no game.
I want them arrested and hanged!
You wouldn't have done that?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
Yes?
Yes, Courtney?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
You never noticed.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
That's nice.
What are you doing tonight?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Why?
It's a plain end, see? So?
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
It's a plain end. I think.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Pull out.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
This is Dorsia?
Are we here?
J&B. Straight.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Eight?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Nice?
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Courtney? Dinner?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Stop it. I'm...
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
It's not that nice.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Really?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Do you take American Express?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
You just haven't been looking.
I have to return some videotapes.
I'm just leaving.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
No, no, no.
You're inhuman.
But what about the past? Our past?
You're really serious, aren't you?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a little something on your upper lip.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
It's not.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Everybody has a great body now.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody's rich.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
I don't want to talk about it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Is your Evian spiked?
Evelyn?
Do...what.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
+++$+++ Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
+++$+++ Because he dated her.
+++$+++ But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
+++$+++ Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
+++$+++ Good coloring.
+++$+++ What are the rules for a sweater vest?
I won't...don't worry.
+++$+++ Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
+++$+++ I think you should go now.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Are you sure?
Doesn't he live here?
+++$+++ Can I help you?
+++$+++ Are you my two o'clock?
No, you...didn't?
Why not, you stupid bastard?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Carnes? Wait.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
What exactly do you mean?
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Patrick?
Where are you going?
Jesus lives, Luis.
Commes des Garcon.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Uh huh.
Lucky, I guess.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Leaving what?
Ask me a question.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
New card. What do you think?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh my God...
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
See you then.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Oh really? That's great.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
+++$+++ Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
Just...say...no!
...to the office this afternoon.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Where are you?
Patrick? Is that you?
Patrick Bateman's office.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Jean? What?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Forget it.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Interesting.
Do you have a boyfriend?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Want a bite?
Jean? Sorbet?
You didn't give them a name.
Dorsia is...fine.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I can't. I don't know.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Anywhere you want?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
Patrick?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Who?
Ye-es, Je-an?
What is it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
You look nice today.
I'll do it.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Just...say...no.
Negative. Cancel it.
When?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Oh really? DAISY He said... He said you gave him bad vibes.
Welt...it depends, why?
Well...
A model? An actor?
So, what do you do?
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Next Saturday?
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Listen, if you could talk to them I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Hello
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Does he do this all the time?
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Paul Owen.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Why would I?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
She's from...France.
She's my...cousin.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
So who was he with?
Where was Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
I've questioned him.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Not in the mood, I guess.
I'll be there.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Let's see... That you were with-
That's not the information I've received.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Not really.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
I mean they want to get caught.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
So...you hang out here a lot?
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Eerie. Really eerie.
People just...disappear.
It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
No.
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Actually, yes.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
So was I.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Don't you know this?
No, he just hung out there.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
Hang...out?
No. Not really.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Yale thing?
How well did you know him?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
You sure?
Would you rather I not smoke?
Bad habit.
Who do you ask?
Thanks.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Shoot.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Understandable. Lime?
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything... Not on "Page Six" at least.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Oh no, I'm okay.
KIMBALL.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Coffee?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in... Just joking... No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it. Sorry about that.
+++$+++ I can't...I can't find a shelter
+++$+++ Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
+++$+++ You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
+++$+++ Al.
+++$+++ Al.
+++$+++ What am I gonna do?
+++$+++ I'm hungry.
+++$+++ I'm hungry
+++$+++ I'm not...
+++$+++ I'm so hungry.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
No, Owen.
Yes, Owen?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Another Martini, Paul?
Cecelia is, well...you know
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Really? That's interesting. Not great?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
+++$+++ What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
+++$+++ Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
+++$+++ You think so?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
You don't wanna move, do you?
I'm just screwed.
"Make" him?
'Gonna wait outside.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You're just afraid to eat it.
It's gonna get cold.
Great.
Oh, right. Hold on.
Milo?
...What?
You look beautiful.
Great!
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life. I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Look at this.
Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me.
That was -- different.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
...Why?
Nothing?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
...Whaddo I do?
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
You can't just walk in, either.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo. Why would he --
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically. Oh Jesus.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
It was a hate crime.
Teddy was killed last night.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
He's your boss. He's not your --
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
To our new life. ...What's wrong?
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
That took some fun out of --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Didn't you visit the campus?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
It's important.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
He wasn't acting?
Prick.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
No.
Yes sir.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
I am. I am, sir.
Have a seat.
Milo?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Right... What's that mean again?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
He's working backwards, too. Let's do number five?
Is it your dish?
Gimme the coordinates?
Wanna be a part of history?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What'd they ever do for you?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck. Can you help me?
+++$+++ You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
+++$+++ Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
+++$+++ Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
+++$+++ There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
+++$+++ Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
+++$+++ Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Oh hi.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
You could've handwritten it.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..." You left my party to send E-mail?
That's great! Thanks.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Sure.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Gary, hi.
The wrong place?
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something. 'Don't know what I'd do without her.
Oh. Yeah.
Talk about work? Never!
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Definitely.
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
What're you implying.
Right... Right.
Milo. What's up?
You did this -- overnight?
It's okay. Really.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before? It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right? In a tree.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
'Think I should buy some originals?
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
I do!
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Would you like a Coke or something?
You would? Wow. When would we come? 'Think he hung up.
...Hello?
Gary?
What?
Longitude 109 --
Ready for number three?
Okay, #2.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Maybe we should all get on it.
This is good. Who did it?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
...You wanna work -- here?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years. Not that I don't miss you.
I mean, it's your life.
I think you should go.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Come with me.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
What're we looking for?
Every entry was authorized.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
...He knows.
Maybe it's the satellite.
Bring it to the other location.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Meet me at the other location.
Please don't go.
Why?!
Does he know you know?
That's lame, isn't it?
Perfect. How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Gary.
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
I told Teddy about you.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Why were you snooping in my office?
Why were you so careless?
I don't know --
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
What?
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN. "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em. It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this. "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Do we post it on the Net?
Who can we trust?
What about the FBI?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
...Milo?
He's out of prison?
Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. I know what he did to you.
But why would they --?
The Day Care?
Why would you do a thing like --
She saved my life.
Then and now. But not right now.
Long story. Not that interesting.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Did you wanna be alone?
Cool!
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Were you?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
You know mine.
Lisa.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Did you tell Alice?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet? Milo?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale. You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
Is that how Larry feels?
...You got my E-mail?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
What're they building?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
She's a programmer?
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big... 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
So how'd you like the house?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there. Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Where is he?
You're not listening.
That kid's the great white hope.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
What is it?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Is it about my teeth?
Kiss me.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Sak-i it to me!
Or sometimes not at all.
Groovy.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Come in.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
You may.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Smashing!
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Hey, how are you?
+++$+++ Be careful!
+++$+++ But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
+++$+++ Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Thanks.
Yes, Basil?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
+++$+++ My God, Austin, what have you done?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Carnies.
Excuse me?
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Hello, Exposition.
+++$+++ Be careful.
+++$+++ There's one more thing, Austin.
+++$+++ Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
+++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
+++$+++ Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
+++$+++ Where is Vanessa, by the way?
+++$+++ Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Yes?
Thank you, Exposition.
Thanks.
Yes?
Thank you, Exposition.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
+++$+++ No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.
+++$+++ Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Where am I?
+++$+++ Be careful.
+++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
+++$+++ Good luck, Austin.
+++$+++ I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
+++$+++ I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
+++$+++ Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Good on ya, man.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Hey, Mick!
Love is... love is... love is...
That does not compute.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
+++$+++ Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
+++$+++ Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
+++$+++ Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
+++$+++ Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
+++$+++ No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
+++$+++ Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
+++$+++ Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Behave!
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Lay it on me.
I'll secure the perimeter.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
Are you crazy?
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa. At ease, boys.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Fair enough.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Not now, Austin.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. Just watch me. Watch me, now.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
You know who.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Not in the Nineties.
No, did you use a condom?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Really, Austin!
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I am not.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I'm sorry.
Go! Just go!
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Fancy a nibble?
I hate having my picture taken.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I don't get it.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let's go get him!
How do you know?
Let me see.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Why did you leave so soon?
I can't see a bloody thing.
Here, use mine.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
What?
Sure.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro... Chigro.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
My meat and two veg.
My wedding tackle.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
My mother's told me all about you.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
That's not mine.
Danger's my middle name.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Where did you learn to shoot?
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Don't mind if I do.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Everything seems to be in order.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
+++$+++ Commander, I have to log it...
+++$+++ Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
+++$+++ In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
+++$+++ It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
+++$+++ No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite. It does have an odd shape, sir.
+++$+++ Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
+++$+++ Right. Okay. Moving on.
+++$+++ You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
+++$+++ Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
+++$+++ We've got a lot of work to do.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is-- --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
But my design was perfect! Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
+++$+++ Really? Are they ill-tempered?
+++$+++ Right.
+++$+++ I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
+++$+++ What is it now?
+++$+++ It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
+++$+++ Dr. Evil?
+++$+++ I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
+++$+++ Quite impressive.
+++$+++ Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
+++$+++ Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
+++$+++ My son?
+++$+++ Yes.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
+++$+++ Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
+++$+++ Scott, don't say that...
+++$+++ I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
+++$+++ Show me.
+++$+++ Blow me.
+++$+++ I don't want to.
+++$+++ No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
+++$+++ No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
+++$+++ Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
+++$+++ Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
+++$+++ But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
+++$+++ Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
+++$+++ Yeah. What?
+++$+++ Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
+++$+++ Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
+++$+++ You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
+++$+++ No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
+++$+++ Not me.
+++$+++ I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
+++$+++ Hi.
+++$+++ Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
+++$+++ Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
+++$+++ Umm, that also has already happened.
+++$+++ Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
+++$+++ We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
+++$+++ I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
+++$+++ Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
+++$+++ Of course not. I was married to your father.
+++$+++ Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
+++$+++ You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
+++$+++ You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
+++$+++ Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
+++$+++ I'm proud of you.
+++$+++ You didn't...
+++$+++ How's Austin?
+++$+++ Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
+++$+++ I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
+++$+++ No, he's really evil.
+++$+++ I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
+++$+++ I don't wanna take over the family business.
+++$+++ OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
+++$+++ Well, it's kind of weird.
No need. I'll call again.
There are limits?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Seriously?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
+++$+++ Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
So I'm still ...
+++$+++ Three days.
+++$+++ Peter ...
+++$+++ Fear ...
+++$+++ Hope...
+++$+++ Secret ...
+++$+++ Nature ...
+++$+++ Flower ...
+++$+++ Love...
+++$+++ Black...
... head ...
... bottle ...
Sir August...? What now?
+++$+++ There, look!
+++$+++ Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Have we met?
+++$+++ Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
+++$+++ You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
I have an appointment.
As you see.
Impossible?
Mr. John Steed, please.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
People, too.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite a collection.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Who?
The Institute ... the funding ...
To you ... ?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
What are you trying to do to me?
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign.
After the cold war ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
He tried to warn us ...
Ropes?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Looks like rain, Steed...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it. Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Choices?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete.
Then what's stopping you?
The result would be ...
Such as?
You're mad.
Ring?
Valentine, listen to me ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
But -- why?
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Too many cooks --
You killed my husband.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Darling Emma -- yes, we: the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Thanks, Valentine ...
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
Not quite.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
As a matter of fact I have ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
What kept you?
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
But --
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Where are you going?
Have a look at this.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Snuff. I must insist you try some.
Shall we?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
What is it?
It's called Black Leather.
Have we been invited?
You didn't tell her?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Aren't you coming?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
No idea who. No idea why ...
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling: he's disappeared ...
I told Mother I took care of you.
You don't trust me?
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Winning isn't everything.
I thought you didn't.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Not for a moment.
Is that all?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Always. Except ...
No trouble.
Nothing personal.
Orders.
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Was I?
Where am I?
Steed ... !
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
This must be the last straw.
Barely.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior. Q.E.D.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you. No sisters? No undiscovered twin?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Is there anything that isn't?
Don't bother. Here's a bus ...
Thanks ... I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Is that written in his shoe?
Any ideas?
Very good, Steed ...
How on earth can you tell?
I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning.
You mean my other self ...
Did you say formal? I must dress.
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed.
You were very lucky. Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
You should be dead. How do you feel?
Small talk. Try the weather.
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
No thanks.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
Do you really think so?
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Or half cocked.
I thought we were on our way.
Do you?
Really? I fail to see the connection.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Mother?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And just what is the game?
Rules are made to be broken.
Whereas you are.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
1922. Why the kippers?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive. He tells me you're very beautiful.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel. We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
You don't believe him?
Where's Mother?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
+++$+++ You're not venturing alone, surely.
+++$+++ Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
+++$+++ Privately owned by ...
+++$+++ 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
+++$+++ Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
+++$+++ The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
+++$+++ I was getting to it.
+++$+++ Makes two of us.
+++$+++ Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
+++$+++ Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
+++$+++ Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Peter's brother? But --
+++$+++ Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
+++$+++ Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father. Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Steed
We want Mrs. Peel.
So you say ...
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
In your operation.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Guilty until proven innocent?
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Impossible.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Anyone particular in mind?
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
She may try to kill you.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Possibly. Split personality ...
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody. I expect you'll like her.
Weather's turning nasty.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
+++$+++ Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
+++$+++ You with Mother or Father?
+++$+++ I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
+++$+++ Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
+++$+++ Are you alright, young man?
+++$+++ Let it be rain, please let it be --
+++$+++ No, please! I beg you ...
+++$+++ Mrs. Peel -- ?
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
You are, and it's behind you.
Did I? My mistake.
I do.
Rules are made to be broken.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
I was at Harrow ...
Perish the thought.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
...Really?
What's happening?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
That's what we're going to find out...
You're kidding.
What do you mean?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
You're kidding.
Yeah. What is it?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Man, you're losing your audience.
I've decided not to run for President.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
When do the girls get to the party?
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Fan out and look for them.
She's mine!
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Maybe it had something to do.
So does Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
The car for Debbie?
I'm very happy for you two.
The best.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I don't want any trouble.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
What is this person's story here?
I'm marrying Debbie.
Not interested.
No.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Cole...
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
And...
+++$+++ Fine. How's everything going?
+++$+++ Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
+++$+++ Hello?
+++$+++ All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
+++$+++ Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
+++$+++ Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
+++$+++ So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
But how can I do that?
I've tried to change her mind.
Yes, sir, I am.
Thank you, sir.
Sure have...
+++$+++ Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
You're so romantic...
Yeah.
You're on.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
I don't believe you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let go of me!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Why don't you get undressed.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're...
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Um... that's very relaxing.
That feels so great.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
I can't sleep.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Are you going to have women at your party?
It looks awful.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
I think your dinner's burning.
What are we having?
God, you're a slob.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Let's go.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I hope those guys are all right.
Quiet, Mother.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
+++$+++ You know your father enjoys his company.
Great, Mom.
+++$+++ Any time, Al.
I think I screwed that one once.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Give him the works.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Why?
What are you...
Screw you!
Your whores never showed up.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Let's see your bread.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Yes.
Screw that.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
What's going on?
Let's have a toast.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Screw you...
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting. Hi, guys.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
What can I be doing for you?
That's it.
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
So, Larry, how have you been?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Ha, ha, ha.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Yeah, I guess so.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
What do you mean, it changes?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Right.
You want to share it?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
It's on the tenth floor.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
+++$+++ No sob story is going to change my mind.
Oh, no!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Feel free.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
I'd love that.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
+++$+++ Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Oops!
+++$+++ No, Brett, I...
+++$+++ The phone made me do it!
+++$+++ You can tell a man by his friends.
+++$+++ In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
+++$+++ No. Let's at least finish the set.
Of course.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Mrs.?
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
My Debbie?
Who?
I'm saved. Let's party!
I'll stop him... You stall him.
What are you going to do about it?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Hey, you guys...
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Very.
Still drawing a blank.
Got me.
I don't know.
I'm proud of you, lad.
How'd it go?
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Oooooo.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
About what?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
So long, Father.
The best table in the house.
My gift to you.
C'mon. I insist.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
This isn't right.
Then it's on to the real thing.
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
What's the matter?
Where the hell is he?
Where'd she go?
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Right... Think it over.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
FRANCIS +++$+++ There can be no excuse for tardiness.
FRANCIS +++$+++ You're late again, Rick.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
I don't know.
Stevie... I...
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
We're gonna be okay, man...
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Wash it to the windows?
Oh these moments do try me...
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
-- He killed people --
Just come down, John. Just --
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
He's alive.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Oh shut up, huh? I think I broke my goddamn arm...
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
You're his Lt., Stephen... Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
What are we going to do about this?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I know.
-- What are you doing here?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I saw it.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
You're selling dad's boat?
So hello.
Hey, what are you doing here?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen. You burned him.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Just leave me alone, okay?
Thanks for the insight.
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
You okay?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Roll the hose.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Yeah... too bright...
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Hey.
Thanks.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Ya love it, probie?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
There's only so much technology can do. Thanks for the beer.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Hey! You don't know me --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
That was never proved.
Sheep don't count.
People actually used to pay you for this?
It works.
What, you've never seen one before?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company. One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
Doesn't work on you. See ya around, little brother.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
It doesn't go like that.
I'll see ya around, huh?
What'll you do?
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Just take it.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Yes.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Hi.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman. Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
I was doing my job.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Brian. What's wrong?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Then why did you quit?
Do you miss it? You seem like you do.
Homey.
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Thanks for the invite.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Marty did. But I wanted you to come to.
You think that's really any of your business?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Hi.
I could use a date.
Green committed to a thousand. There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
How's it going?
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Yeah...
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
When I was twenty.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
I work for city hall.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Huh.
Thanks for calling.
You're back.
Brian.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Who the fuck is doing this?
Trychticholorate.
The outlets.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
What?
Sure you do.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Brian McCaffrey... Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
+++$+++ Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
+++$+++ Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
+++$+++ -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
+++$+++ Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
+++$+++ You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Like it never happened...
Yeah.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close... We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
No.
Yeah.
How ya feeling?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Yeah? Airtight?
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Fire.
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But the right guess on this is arson.
And the putty around the door?
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Read.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn. You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad? Or scared. It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Glass?
What are you listening to?
Pest control.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. You think you're the first?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Are you still here?
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Four months?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
It isn't mine. Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
I have a job.
Every little boy's fantasy.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Yeah. Big fan.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Backdraft.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Aren't you even curious?
Completely out of control.
I was ahead of my time.
Coffee sucked.
Management were pin heads.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
It's in my blood, Willy.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes. How 'bout it, sport?
Cute.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
And DIE!
Well, let's have a look.
Who's going to die?
They're waitin' man.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
He just wants to --
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
What's wrong?
You can't keep being his father...
Yeah? When was the last time?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
You want some coffee?
I treated you better.
He treats you okay?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Where's Sean?
Fixing my roof.
Here we go...
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
That's your job.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Putty? On both doors?
-- Burn it all.
-- Burn them.
-- Burn them.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Knock it off. Now.
You don't know him.
Is he a fireman? I like firemen.
Who's this?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Shadow.
It knows us. This one knows us.
You don't know... nobody knows...
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
I'm working on it.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Investigator...
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Don't you have any leads at all?
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Inspector.
Investigator Rimgale.
I'm a Catholic.
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Who?
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... First time shooting up?
Yeah.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. You gotta believe me!
Yeah.
People.
What's to believe?
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in, You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand? No. How could you understand.
So what are you doing here?
WOMAN +++$+++ Are you all right, honey?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
You took the chalice.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Fuck you. Just give me back a little something for the road.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
I forgive you.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me! Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done. I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Me?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Oh, really?
Let me think about it.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
All right, cop. I want my money.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
You've really got a problem.
That 50 G could help you --
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
How's the case going?
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
You're a fucking joke, you know that? He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
This psycho can.
Don't bullshit me.
Do you have the money?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Are you sure?
How about 7 1/2?
All right. What are you gonna do?
You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
+++$+++ You truly are a dancing fool.
+++$+++ He gots to be did.
+++$+++ We know. We know. Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide. Not this injustice. Nah, no way. Dem' two real coons iz ill.
+++$+++ ...that simpleton is holding back the race. They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
+++$+++ I'm on it.
+++$+++ B-L-A-K it is.
+++$+++ How 'bout...
Louder. They can't hear you.
Let's go NIGGERS.
YEAH!
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me. Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different. Can you do this for me?
Ho!
That's mighty black of you.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
That'swhatI'msayin'. I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
You don't have the demographics.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Delacroix.
Please.
Who are you revolting against?
Hook you up? The Mau-Mau's? You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
I order out mostly. So what do I owe this visit to?
+++$+++ BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
+++$+++ Whoa, hold up li'l sis'. I done told you 'bout that. Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name. My true name is...
+++$+++ Give me some?
+++$+++ I didn't mean to scare you like that.
+++$+++ Microphone check. One. Two. One. Two. One. Two. Hold up. I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
+++$+++ We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists. We drop science.
+++$+++ My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
+++$+++ The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
+++$+++ And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
+++$+++ What do you do?
+++$+++ And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
+++$+++ Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn. Go 'head.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Damn skippy.
Good. I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Meaning?
What are you talkin' about?
Look at my lips.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Please, have a seat.
What's wrong with him?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
You'd try anything. I got first dibs. You get ya own stuff.
Seconds and thirds, too.
What's that?
Certified ladies' man, huh?
It's that bad, huh? It's all over my face.
I'm not smiling.
You might be right.
That can be done.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical. You know what that is, don't you? Trust me on this one.
Nice to meet you.
What about in the mean time? Not the in between time?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
How much?
Manray needs a job.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Y'know what I mean. Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
We're starving.
We was coming to see you.
Are you crazy? The joint is crawling with cops now. You wanna go to Rikers? Go to the hoosegow?
I'm tired of waiting.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, check it. This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Did we get our bill yet?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
No costume. No blackface.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan. Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother. I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work. You gotta be professional.
How you sound?
Mantan!!
You have to start getting into your character.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
You're now Mantan.
I would like to change your name.
DeLa, I'm aboard. As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
How different?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
EUREKA!!
Well do something about it.
Can I finish? Thank you. I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
Don't you people get it? We're in the 21st Century. Slavery was over four hundred years ago. All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over. Folks always crying, white man this, white man that. Let's all grow up.
Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news. I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier. From the gitgo, from jump street.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen. Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier.
Calm down, please.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough. Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it? Do you want it that much.
No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. It's un-American. I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout! He's off the hiz-hook!
I don't know about that plantation angle.
Ya first bad move. Projects been done. That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired. Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation. In Alabama.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting?
Who are the other characters?
So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Let'em try. I will kill to make this happen.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Exactly!
What are there character traits?
I want you take it there. All the way to the edge and back.
That's a great handle.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I'm lovin' it. You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
The name of the show?
Word!!!
Go on. Good so far.
I'm wid it.
It's right and tight. Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week. I want advertisers dying to buy on this show. I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you. I need a mid-season replacement and pronto. It will be on the fast track.
That's exactly what I think. I want you to create something that people want to see. Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans. You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles. This is a golden opportunity now. These idiots have to be led to the water.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways. Brother man, I'm blacker than you. I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave. The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son. And so on and so forth. It's too clean, too antiseptic...
I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER.
I understand Black culture. I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix. Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word. I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word. I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right. Nigger is just a word. If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I understand. But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late. That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Four minutes ago.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I love you too, Daddy.
Let's get him over to the bed.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Where do you go from here?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The same old, same old. Trying to get my stuff through.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Because I had too much pride. Too much integrity. I wouldn't lick nobody's butt. Some material I refused to do.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
I did. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Pleased to meet you.
It's been a long time.
It's me, Peerless.
I want to speak with you.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Your father is proud of you.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him. I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Not that often. He was excited to see you.
Is that so?
Give me the gun.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
That's why it will be so much fun.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big mistake. I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Light?
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
Why'd you do that?
How so?
Is that good or bad?
Thanks.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
For what?
What is this?
So you have your small victory, now what?
What would their reaction be? I hadn't the foggiest.
Who's side are you on?
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's. I should not have imposed them on you.
Same here.
What do you want me to say?
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Break a leg.
I'm gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat. For the love of Joseph.
The big one.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Hello.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Fuck da money. Why do through all this effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect? Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. So now what are you gonna do?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
What is your problem?
You okay?
Hello.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Can't you just quit? Walk away?
I'm in till the end.
Sounds risky to me.
What point is that?
You lost me.
Do you know how you will use him?
The idea was out there in the universe. Now what?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Manray!
It wasn't my fault. If I would have known, I would have known.
Nobody told me anything.
How was it?
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
Hi, Mona.
Yes, your name?
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place? I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Yeah.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
No.
In time.
No joke. Serious.
Same thing Giuliani said.
You sound like the media.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
I feel fine.
Naw. I'll take the zero.
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Pressure? DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Soon.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Not at all?
Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me?
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Even more reason to see him. He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Yes he did.
He wants you to come and see him.
Peerless, your father called.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
I know what's on my birth certificate. You heard from Daddy?
Mommy, please don't call me that.
It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.
Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I said no such thing. All I said is that something must be wrong.
You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show.
Then will you teach me what I need to know. Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you for correcting my ignorance. I'm looking forward to working side by side with you. I feel we make a good team.
Ahhh!!! I never heard of that term before. I thought you were BLACK of African-American. No?
A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An abomination.
Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Finland.
Where are you from?
Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Yes you!
Let Myrna finish.
The Mantan Manifesto. Catchy ain't it? Number One. We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras. Two. Let the audience decide. Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four. Who determines what is black? Five. Mantan is a satire. Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings. Through the roof. But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead. I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
I think that would probably make you the happiest. When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
You're welcome. You shouldn't give up on performing.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with. You look beautiful like that.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
You sing and dance?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I never had a really real pair before.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.
Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money. Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
EAT +++$+++ A song a comin' I feel.
EAT +++$+++ Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter. My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother. My father's wife also became the mother of a son. He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter. Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
I don't know who I am.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you? Using all dose ten dollar words?
I slept too near where I fell out.
I fell out of my bed last night.
EAT +++$+++ ...like grits and butter...
EAT +++$+++ That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
EAT +++$+++ ...too late, maybe around...
EAT +++$+++ ...too early...
EAT +++$+++ So when are you comin' to pick us up?
EAT +++$+++ ...I heard different, thought that was...
EAT +++$+++ ...no, she didn't...
EAT +++$+++ No. That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
EAT +++$+++ We should go out on a double date.
EAT +++$+++ ...aconite get it dat cheap.
EAT +++$+++ ...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
EAT +++$+++ Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...to big. The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
She hates dem.
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
Not her, the one with the little...
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
EAT +++$+++ You tellin' the truth.
EAT +++$+++ Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
EAT +++$+++ Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
EAT +++$+++ Our Alabamy Home. Now we're getting countrified. We is Bama's.
EAT +++$+++ ...the big apple, New York, New York.
EAT +++$+++ And this is my very best friend Mantan.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Don't try to change to the subject.
So you say. Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top. I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP." I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Aw, c'mon.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Stop playing me Sloan.
And?
You leave something out?
How did you get this gig?
What?
I'll be down front. You better start putting your face on.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Why don't you call him?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up. They had no choice. They were considered 3/5ths of a human being. Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
Maybe you need to start.
You don't read, do you?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface. You ever heard of Bert Williams? He was a great artist.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Oh you do, huh?
This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.
What else?
The good stuff.
So what's up with you?
A lot?
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
+++$+++ Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
+++$+++ Where are you bound for?
+++$+++ Good day to you, young sir.
+++$+++ Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
+++$+++ And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house. I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Pooh! Pooh! Best, you are joking.
Well, well! What is it? We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
And his baggage?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
I am not sure. The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
+++$+++ I had thought you more expert. You must find out if the Chevalier cheats. He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house. Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole. If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there. But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger. He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
+++$+++ You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins. He gambles a great deal, and wins. Do you know the cards well?
What is the service, sir?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
+++$+++ Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
+++$+++ It's a lie! You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know. Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
+++$+++ I have acted as I think fit.
+++$+++ It was my joke. I was tired, and did not care to go farther. There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
+++$+++ The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
+++$+++ Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
+++$+++ Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
+++$+++ What is your uncle's name?
+++$+++ He has paid off your uncle's mortgage. He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six. That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family. Faith, the business was well done. Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin. Are you in want of cash, my boy? You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
+++$+++ No, the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family? The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you. But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
+++$+++ She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband. She is now Mrs. John Best.
+++$+++ There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
+++$+++ I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
+++$+++ Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business. The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Best is willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service. Make Best an apology, and be off.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
+++$+++ And now you risk the same fate. If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
+++$+++ That's a very handsome sword you have there.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Have you taken my message to him?
He'll give the better mark. I am not afraid of him.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan. I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine. Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
And so I am.
+++$+++ Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
+++$+++ Tut, tut! I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah! You change color, do you? Your secret is known, is it? You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit. I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find? A fraud.
+++$+++ You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
+++$+++ Whom have I been harboring in my house? Who are you, sirrah?
Ah -- I see. No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Which O'Higgins do you know? For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish. Good night.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
I don't know.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I have no luggage.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Ten thousand? But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
It is shameful -- infamous! I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Good gracious! What is this?
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Certain?
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
But how, sir?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I believe they will deport you.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Only the agency of servants.
No one, sir. Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Here is my letter.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Then you yield to me.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one. Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me. We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes. One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth. She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you. But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself. I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love! God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter. Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead. And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal. If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more. But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Always, my dear one, never any further. Love is a child to be pacified with trifles. A full diet can only kill it.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
You want my heart?
How so?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
It is only too possible. Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate? If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself. If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. I could value only someone whom I loved.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Not one.
Not even that.
Never.
No.
Monster! Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. But I'll have my revenge, I will! Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London. It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Oh! I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Then you must get it.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field? The first to touch it will be the winner.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
All the same, you must name an amount.
As much as possible?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Yes!
+++$+++ Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy. I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
+++$+++ Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
What is to be done?
When is he to go?
The Prince left him only that choice.
+++$+++ Hmm-mmmm.
+++$+++ Was he cheated?
+++$+++ Does this assignment interest you?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies. In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality. To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
+++$+++ But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
+++$+++ That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. Have you lost much?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
I see.
Yes, of course.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill? Are you serious?
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, papa.
What the devil? What kind of fools do we have here? Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Yes?
Good night, my little darling.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.
+++$+++ I am sorry for you Mr. James. I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting. Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic? What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
+++$+++ Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps. Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation. Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
+++$+++ Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor? Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
+++$+++ He wants to step into my shoes! He wants to step into my shoes!
+++$+++ Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith. Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
+++$+++ Come, come, sir. I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
+++$+++ Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
+++$+++ Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance. For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me? A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power. My wife never comes near me. What friend have I? None in the wide world. Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
+++$+++ In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
+++$+++ Indeed, you are right, sir. Look at me. Marriage has added forty years to my life. I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty. When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself. Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable. Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps. Do anything, but marry.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table. One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
He loves me, as I love you.
He is only curious to know who you are.
Yes. He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Dark Valdez.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Who?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Can I at least have a drink?
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
You framed-him...
He is the only one unaccounted for.
What about Pike?
Did -- did you --
I don't want to go --
What do we do?
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
West was one thing, but this --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
Before or after the explosion? Mueller --
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We found him like this --
Can anybody hear me!
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Shut up. West's dead.
We found him like this...
What do you mean, alone?
We don't know. West is dead.
He's telling the truth up to a point...
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
And the bodies?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
He -- He made me do it --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
You wanna bet?
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
But not Pike's.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Yeah --
Of course --
I apologize --
I didn't shoot West --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I'm serious --
He's lying.
That son of a bitch.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
You smoke, Ray?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Some.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Okay.
They're dead, aren't they?
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
What do you like then?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Why not?
How do you know that?
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Where's the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
The creek bed --
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Your weapons, Sergeant.
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Cadet, what's your name!
So you killed him?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Jesus, what happened?
Why?
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
He wouldn't kill anybody...
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
I... I don't know...
They?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
From up close or far away?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
Why?
Bullshit.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Oh, come on --
If not you, then who?
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Right?
You know it's not like that --
We just want to check your pack --
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there -- Where's West?
I mean I killed him. Isn't that what we all wanted?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Maybe he...
Maybe --
I don't know --
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
How do you know?
Why?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Something funny, Levi?
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Well?
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that. Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Is it the truth?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Stop.
Mr. Hardy?
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
No. Poetic justice, though.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was... Enough to almost kill him.
I didn't kill him --
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. I am a homosexual.
But not the only victim, right?
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Get your hands away from the desk!
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
That's preposterous --
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Stay where you are.
You're drunk --
What are you talking about?
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
The Senator...
I wouldn't know where to start. I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
Yeah.
What I said before --
What the hell are you talking about --
What about the confession?
Tom, where are you going --
You mean not enough to save you.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
What kind of trouble are you in?
How are you?
He was your friend.
Your phone number?
I should probably write that down.
Want company?
Think it'll work?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
You're a good man, Hardy.
That's not true.
What if I don't want it?
This isn't the time --
What?
We need to talk --
No bodies, no West...
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Isn't this how your story goes?
Right back where we started.
Get in.
Good, just making sure.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
That's gonna stay my secret.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Nah.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
So did I.
You wanted to break him.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
I pushed him too hard.
That's a fantastic idea --
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
Are you sure?
What?
We're fucked, I know --
Little bit.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Buttfucks the cabin?
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Dunbar.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What?
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy.
But you will.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I lied. Wait for it...
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
Got it.
Not the happiest of memories?
Something wrong?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
You're off to a late start.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You're kidding.
Something like that. You?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
What is that?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You made me look like an idiot --
Baseball?
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
Good cop/bad cop?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Is Dunbar cute?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Move him.
He's in interrogation?
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
You and the Colonel go back.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
You knew Sergeant West?
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
So you took off your shirt?
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Pike and I got separated --
Poor fucker my ass...
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
The faggot speaks.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Who, Levi --
Wrong answer --
What.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
It won't work --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Dunbar says you were.
Pike never confessed.
Fifty minutes.
We've been making progress, I see.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
He whispered it in my ear.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He wanted more than that.
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Shut up!
Bullshit --
The fuck are you talking about --
We're not going anywhere.
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Shut the fuck up. He was gonna cut him loose.
What the fuck are you doing?
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Yeah.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
You want Kendall, don't you?
What do you think?
You think he did it?
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
He's not Army, it's not official --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
This is totally unnecessary --
+++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Thank you.
There's only one I want.
That would explain the indigestion.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Yes!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
That's great.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I don't expect to.
No one's ever left.
Why?
It truly is.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
What is this place?
You were expecting me?
Yes.
Edward Bloom.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Don.
+++$+++ Let's see it.
+++$+++ You get the eye?
+++$+++ Fine, you do it.
+++$+++ Then do it.
+++$+++ Or are you too scared?
No.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
+++$+++ Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. How would his son describe him?
+++$+++ Thirty years. Maybe more.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
+++$+++ Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
+++$+++ A pleasure.
+++$+++ Will.
Lucky girl.
I know.
Go.
Please. Go. Just go.
I can get it. I can just...
I see. I thank you for your time.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
Helping people makes me happy.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
How did you know?
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How old are you?
Yeah.
Well, she... uh...
Did you see that woman?
I like your stories.
You were talking about your wedding.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Well, it's not a short one.
Will never told you that? Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Spooning the sherbet.
Stop.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
That's terrible.
What were you dreaming about?
Hi. How are you feeling?
Really.
You're not trying to run away?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
What did she say?
Okay.
You don't like it?
Karl.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
I can.
Really?
Yes. Exactly.
Story of my life.
The River!
Where are we headed?
Let's get out of here.
Like this.
How I go.
Tell me how it happens.
The river.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
It would kill you, huh?
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Dad!
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Son?
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Why not religion, Dad?
I thought you weren't dying.
You know where the chemicals are?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
You mean, while I'm here.
You're right.
When did you ever work in an office?
Really.
What did he say?
Okay.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
She was a witch.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
You think I'm up for it?
Did you do any of that?
Am I?
I'm not scared.
The one about the witch.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Jesus Christ.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
I was drying out.
How can I convince you to stop?
You don't even know me.
How did you get so many?
Daffodils?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
'Fraid so.
+++$+++ I'm robbing this place.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
I don't believe it!
+++$+++ It's me. Norther Winslow.
+++$+++ I can't imagine any place better than here.
+++$+++ This is why you don't show work in progress.
Really.
+++$+++ There is no softer ground than town.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Because he's dying.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Were you and my father having an affair?
How did you know my father?
Are you Jenny Hill?
Hello.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I'm going to check on him.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Yes.
Is he going to be okay?
What happened?
I need you on my side.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
But it's not true.
Do you love him?
Do you love your father?
Mmm, what?
But it's romantic.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You never told me how your parents met.
I talked with your father last night.
You don't have to.
Probably tonight.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Yes. Thank you.
That's okay?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he... In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
So you never bought any land.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Mom?
Is he awake?
That really happened?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man. The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories. You can't honestly say you know him.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How much time does he have left?
How is he?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
We rented a car.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
I paid for those guitar cases.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
No I don't.
What for?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
No I haven't.
Leave him!
What are you doing here?
Name it.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It is. I did it cooking.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
We'll stop then.
Do you want to stop?
What do you mean?
There's over eighty thousand here.
Right.
Hello.
+++$+++ You can see why it's sensitive?
+++$+++ To customers approaching the bank from the rear
+++$+++ This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
I'm so sorry.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Oh Jesus.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
He wants the money from your bank.
He wants a lot of money.
He wants money.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What? What does he want?
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
Put the fucking kettle down.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
Do you believe in love?
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Tell me what he said.
Tell me.
What was that?
Binoculars.
I...
When?
She says she has a secret to tell.
Uh. Do you like England?
No, no...
You must have a visa or something...
So how long will you be in England?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Good.
Oh. We are Russian.
He says he feels safe here.
What?
Sorry. You've lost me...
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
My name's Sophia.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
What does it mean?
It's a long way to go for a date.
No. What? No. I know.
Why?
It's not mine either.
Please.
Whatever.
Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Something else.
Okay. Goodbye.
Please. Why not?
Whatever.
No. I think I better just go.
It's alright.
What's your name?
I don't know.
Except for Small Eyes.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I'm trying to quit.
Laugh it up.
She's alive?
What?
I'm sorry.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Are you scared?
Have you had any before?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
I don't have nothing.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
I wasn't saying anything.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You are throwing me out.
Excuse me?
You don't understand me.
It wasn't what I wanted.
I got what I paid for.
What?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Some... What does that mean?
Sometimes which?
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
And who says what is wrong.
And? What are you saying?
I don't hate you.
We'll pretend it never happened.
No.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Excuse me?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Oh Jesus.
So uh...
It's none of your business.
I don't want to talk about him.
I said I don't have any.
I don't have any money.
Yes.
What?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Where's the restroom?
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I know you just want to punish me --
No I don't.
Well as it turns out I did.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I don't want to know.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
You don't understand anything.
They go.
They go.
They go. John. They go.
"Frenzy".
Syevodnya
Happy bath day.
Sorry?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Yes.
Cash.
Thanks.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Is the flight full?
Then start taking them seriously.
You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you?
What are you doing?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you. Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Can I come in?
I need ya help again.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
At church?
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I bet you have loyal customers.
This was very sweet of you.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
I already tossed that out. Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Not if no one finds out.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Is your niece older than 12?
You take her to a doctor?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
Yes?
Well. It's good to see you.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support. Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Lazarus?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Okay.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Hi.
+++$+++ Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin. This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
+++$+++ These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
+++$+++ Well, that makes it easier.
+++$+++ And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
You gonna steal my truck?
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me. And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
Now wait...
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it. These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
You need a ride?
You been home yet?
She's around. Always is.
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
What happened?
Sure.
Yeah.
You gonna miss your bus.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that. But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Jes? Jesse? Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Yeah.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
You wanna go home?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Rose... please...
Better'n me?
Kept us warm for twelve years.
I keep the heat on.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house... ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME! You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason. You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
You sayin' you'll do what?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Maybe I won't.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
What I love.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
You can handle it.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
What is it?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon. You ready for this?
You think God forgives people like that? You think God forgives people like me?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
The... chain helps.
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now. Where am I gonna put all this love?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Could you do somethin' for me?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Still makin' jokes?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Sure.
You drink whiskey?
Well, get to it.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out. Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk. Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all? You know how to boil water?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Let go of me...
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story... Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in. Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Means ya healin'. So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong. Sting a bit?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
I CAN'T!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Whose doin' is that?
Or what?
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will. Right or wrong, you gonna mind me. Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
In my house, you watch that lip...
No ma'am.
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Why you got me chained?
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Don't need none.
Wait. He left.
Where's Ronnie?
Two days?
How long... how long I been out?
Come on, gal...
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem. Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
How a girl get like that?
Nuh-uh.
Go ask him.
He tapped that.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Shit. Who hasn't?
I don't pimp that. You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
You need some weed?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. Who gives this girl in marriage?
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
Heard about this morning.
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
Not like that.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Ask the chef.
This all looks wonderful.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I told you to TURN BACK!
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
You get a call from Rose?
Why's his britches round his knees?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I didn't start this, R.L.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
So... That your first time?
Please don't tell my daddy.
Why she got a chain on her?
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus. You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Yes'sir.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie. Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Can I ask you a question? People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You a preacher?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Thank you.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Yeah, I do.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Holy shit, Ronnie! You're a fuckin' rock star.
Holy shit!
Are you wasted?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
Hey.
Rae!
Rae don't do this now...
Rae...
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma. I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me. And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I just wanted some make-up.
Yeah. I know I did. But... I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
No. That's not why... Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
Got in a little accident.
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests. Your money ticket get shipped today?
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead. Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
What'd I tell you? I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Thought you had a man for that.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help? Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
It's incredible. Hit him or something.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I hope not.
You said that in the last two places.
First decent idea you've had.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Nick, we can't just --
In Rome, I'll bow.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
I didn't know.
You didn't take, did you...? You hear things.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Nick... You up?
What'd you say?
Not a prayer.
They say we got to turn around and come right back. That's what they say. I got a plan.
What are you missing? Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What are you doing?
Maybe we should do something?
The Wolf?
What?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Who do you think the Jap is?
What are they doing now?
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that. I absolutely anticipated that, Nick. But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Nick, let's go hunting. Bag Cavello.
It's not regulation. And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Get rid of it.
Let go...
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
-- Cavello. Ronnie Cavello.
Home.
Thanks.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
I think she got to you, pappy.
What does Charlie mean?
You all right? You okay?
You cool, Ich?
What'd she say?
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
I wasn't expecting you.
If you give me one.
You'll take care of that.
All right, how's the new partner?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Short shift?
We can't lose.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Call for help.
You all right?
Why's that?
Luck.
Me too.
A wife. She left.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Joyce?
How many men?
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
You did great, Ichiro.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Start it.
No.
It's done. You don't have to come.
Let's go. Him first.
So I bring some cheese?
What's in the box?
It's a new deal. ... coming with me tomorrow?
Big enough.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
I want to go talk to him.
Where does this Sugai live?
Nick!
Ich, my name is Nick. Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I want to yank Kobo.
Shut-up.
We're through. I mean it. This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
You can trust me.
I'll check it out.
You can't come in. They don't want --
She disappeared... shit!
Yakuza.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Nick...
You're doing fine, Ich. Now drop it, okay?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
There she is!
Nick...
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days. He might not even be in Tokyo.
What's he saying?
We can ask someone I used to work with. A criminal. Someone I pay money to...
I stole them.
I can see that.
I'll get him for you, Nick.
You must leave?
Why weren't you at the platform?
They made you leave your hotel... ... you caused a disturbance.
I don't, that's all.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Give us a break...
What's the problem here?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's. Let's book, Charlie. If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's. And call me Ich.
Where would you look for the mafia?
I'd like that.
Might be different in New York.
Can't make you change your mind?
What if I chant?
Why would you care?
No one's keeping him here.
The cheese...
Tell them I'm not.
Who am I supposed to be?
I don't remember you saying no.
Not if it works. I'll meet you at the train?
What do you chant?
You met her.
He's got a reason.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
And I'm supposed to care?
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood.
Where's Ich?
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I paid for that.
Don't be an ass.
She ever pull down her shades?
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
You have a helluva way of answering.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
I could use some help. Show me around. I'll pay you for your time.
Gaiijin?
There was a change in plans.
He gets as much as he wants.
Then take it from him.
Don't be.
This is my stop.
She's such a long way home for you.
I like your friend, Joyce. You're lucky.
Save it, I already took the tour.
I'm taking you back.
Right.
Your plane's at nine a.m. Be on it. That's orders. Period.
How? You don't know the place. You don't know the language. Get on the plane.
They're blaming it on you. Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
It's not your job.
Why me?
What...? What if I say no?
What?
Why?
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
One guy do all the damage?
Not in that company.
This by this...
Goodbye, officer.
-- Do you know where she is, detective? Do you know how to find her? Even where to start? We will find them.
You had my help, detective.
Your plane leaves at six. Two officers will escort you.
Hey...! HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
What's this?
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Do you know what this is?
Work with me. I want your best detective.
We're police officers.
I want a gun.
You lost a man we wanted for some time. It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
You want him dead too.
He'll find out you took me. I'm unprotected. He'll kill us. All of us. You don't stand a chance.
I don't have to.
If I say no?
With these?
You trust me?
Why tell me this?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Yes. Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
I want him.
-- Kobo... I know. He killed two of my partners. One in New York, one at the printing plant.
Seven years work by the finest engraver. Mass produced, sequentially numbered. The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Then go get him.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
What's the point?
Where?
Pris?
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary?
If he won't cooperate?
Well stocked.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Also extraordinary things.
I am?
Put it this way. Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship. The ship sinks.
The facts of life. I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal. A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
I want more life, fucker.
Death.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Here's your check, my boy. Thank you.
Oh?
No, you stay here with us. Out last night together.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
You're our best and only friend.
When do you deliver your project?
Be better if I could talk to him in person. But he's not an easy man to get to.
His company made us.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Dr. Tyrell?
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
You could help us.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems. Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
We have a lot in common.
Like what?
Nexus - 6.
You're androids.
You're just all so... so different.
Well, actually
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Well, no, not really. There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Okay, but don't kill him. Save a little for everybody. A masterpiece.
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home. How are things at home?
Hello, glad to meet you.
Tomorrow, he says.
He's not ready yet.
Go.
If you don't, we will. It has to be total, Deckard. That's an order from as high as it comes. Got it?
Got it.
Who.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, go home. Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
I didn't like her.
She was gonna get away.
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
Industrial refuse.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model. Check it out on the Voight-Kampff. There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect. If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing. Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees. Guess he found himself one.
Five. Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation. Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Oh! Day after tomorrow.
When might that be?
Well, when do you get paid?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Number three.
Next.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Never mind. Do they have that knowledge?
The umbrella.
Not if it works.
Yes?
What about a summary then.
Here's something you might find interesting. They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Okay, but...
How do I stop one?
You start.
You equipped for random questions?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass. Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill. I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me. Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image. If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
How old am I?
One more, eh?
I like you.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
Those cockroaches?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Prosit.
My pleasure.
Shot of vodka, please.
I'll but you one. What'll you have?
It's okay. Forget it.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
What's that?
Let's hear it.
Money?
From what I hear you're doing great. Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army. Making a lot of money, huh?
Hey, it's okay. I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Don't make me laugh. It makes me pee.
I'm great. I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great. How you like my new suit?
My job is here.
Too old.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Nope.
True.
Huh huh.
Yeah?
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
I didn't say that. Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Nerves of steel.
What shows?
Book the good ones for where?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act. But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Nothing. She wanted to know about suck night.
Who?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know. Naw. There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
I'd like you to take a look at these pictures.
Yes?
And who do I go to about you?
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Sorry.
Come on.
The best.
It's a good job.
It that mother real?
What the fuck for?
Are you for real?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
I don't know nothing about it.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know what I think?
What difference will it make?
No, I don't.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Because it's not.
Nope. Nobody could stand me that long.
What's a long time?
You mean a woman?
I never felt better.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid. Part of your education.
I don't like the noise. Just practice. Practice makes perfect.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Like?
What?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
That's another thing I can't do.
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah. Sometimes.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Not too good.
I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Oh.
Where is he?
Who is this?
You did?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Sit.
Don't just stand there looking at me. It's not polite.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
I can imagine.
Yeah.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
There's two reasons a man rejects help. Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I've already got more help than I need.
Is there anything else?
Last question. You're watching an old movie. It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
It would be my child.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I'd never get an abortion.
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
You have a little boy. He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
For the responsibility of your power. Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Are you apprehensive?
It's artificial?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard. If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
I'll see you in a minute.
Bad?
What's up?
You know where I been. I been on vacation.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
She didn't know?
How many questions did it take?
If she is, the machine works.
Sitting next to you.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard. The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
May I ask a personal question?
Yes.
Please.
Thanks.
+++$+++ I'm tired of this.
+++$+++ How do you know I'm not?
+++$+++ Sorry.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I never seen a turtle.
Of course.
A tortoise. What's that?
But how come I'd be there?
What desert?
What one?
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. Answer quickly as you can.
Sorry.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
What makes you think so?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
As a matter of fact I did. They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Yes. I couldn't pass the test.
My glands. They grow old too fast.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Twenty.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Beautiful.
You look... better.
Whatcha doin'?
I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place?
We sure did.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
They left.
Oh.
You want to go home?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What's your name?
How come you were in my truck?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Really?
+++$+++ He's really funny!
+++$+++ This is my new friend...
+++$+++ Bravo!
+++$+++ Oh, now, that's a great one!
+++$+++ Yes?
Young man, stop right there!
Yes, ma'am.
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
For how long?
Come where?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
It certainly is. I agree with you completely.
Do ya?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
What?!
Oh, brother...
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
How do you do?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
No.
...I do.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing. The best thing for you. I promise.
Hi, Eve!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
It was at least as good as the sky.
Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Of course. I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Yes, Eve?
No.
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live." It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live." You know it?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
There.
I know first aid!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
What?
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry!
Eve?!
But, Eve, I would--
Eve, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
No. I admire you. I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most--
I've never lied to you. I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
You wanted to see me!
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
That's ridiculous.
Really?
Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
How 'bout this one?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Why?! I think she's very attractive.
What about her?
What have you ordered?
I like her.
I thought I was here to meet women.
Quit showing off! We're here on business!
Do I look crazy?
Look unimpressed.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Okay!
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
About clothing?
The guy with the underpants!
The what?
All right.
May I please be excused?
In the house?
He has a computer?
Where's he gone?
Yeah, right! That's where you'd go to find girls! Nome. He's gay, by the way.
You live in...Alaska. The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Here you go. One champagne cocktail.
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question?
Yes!
I was wrong!!
Never drive again!
You almost got us killed!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Now, get out!!
Get out!
Of course.
That's what I was afraid of.
Two weeks.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
One who's not a mutant.
It didn't used to be that way.
They're all divorced?
I didn't know that.
It does?
Bites what?
I don't want to be alone.
Because I want to get married.
Yes.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
This is for me.
Then forget it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Okay.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - - but, I'd just be lost without you.
I guess we'll need another locker.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Sorry.
What?
Hey! Pipe tobacco! I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
My Mom and Dad.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Sure.
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's the pay?
How long would you need me?
Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people?
Doing what?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why?! Who the hell knows?!
What?
See, ya.
Hey, no kidding? In color?
The eyes. Okay. An eye-man. Anyhow, it never works out. Okay? Not that you even need to know that! You look like crap, by the way. What have you been doing?
Oh, stop that! God! Listen, I know you like me. I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me. Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair. Or some combination of the above.
No.
Okay! Damn!
I knew this would happen! You're like a lost puppy!
Wait, Eve, please! Wait.
I haven't brushed yet.
Okay.
I can't, it's yours.
I am so glad to see you!! I thought I'd never see you again!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
I know a short-cut.
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Over this?
How's that?
Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back!
It's Perry!
Wait! Wait!
It's Webber. Adam Webber.
Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
And that's it?
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Get away from me!!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!! I mean it!!
You don't?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again?
Yes, I'm right?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay. Right so far?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Here, pick these up!
What's wrong with you?
Dickhead?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
No, I'm lost.
Where are we going?
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Get out of here!
No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Yes, sir.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Nothing.
Is this because of the radiation?
Yes, it is.
+++$+++ Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
I promise.
How do I leave here?
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I've got to go, now.
I know it has been terrible. But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
All in yellow? Oh! That was my father!
Are you all right?
Uh, I think they have.
Uh-huh.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
That's what everybody believes?
You're sure?
Uh-huh.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
I'll try.
I promise. Is that all?
Adult Bookstore. Why?
Yes, sir. Is that all?
Yes, father?! Yes?
Merci!
Shit is a French word?
No, son! We wait for night. Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Blow out the candles!
Because he must!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Like one of Mom's?
Like a painting?
What's baseball?
These are wonderful.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Gerade aus dann links!
Tempus fugit!
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.
They're pretty. Can I have them?
What?
Bye, Adam!
Goodbye.
Yeah...Seems to.
I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.
So, did you buy a movie?
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
No! There's an Adult Bookstore back there! I'll be right back!
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Oh. I see.
Why did you park way back there?
That's why little things mean so much to him.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Almost all of them.
No.
Okay.
Why not? He has great pants.
Not on him.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Yes. He likes windows.
Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.
That would knock my father out.
Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America.
No.
I don't think so.
It's so small.
This must be very new.
Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha!
What's the capitol?
When did we get it from them?
Who use to own it?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Really? Since when?
And it's called...?
You nut!
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Goodnight.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Twenty-five? Around there.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old are you?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
The hotel.
You dial nine to get out.
+++$+++ I don't see anything!
+++$+++ The sky? Where?
+++$+++ What? What is it?!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is! Would you excuse me?
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties.
Good!
How do you do, ma'am.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Well, we're here to help!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Really? No kidding?
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Hello.
No.
Well, where are you --
This is your bedroom?
We have to go.
What?
A psychiatrist?!
Are you in trouble, son?!
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl. I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Mom?
Right.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
I'll be all right.
I'll go up.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get him into the bedroom.
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Elbows, Son.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
No! Not the police! Don't call them!
Oh, my God!
Good god.
He drank it hot?
All back East.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
+++$+++ Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
+++$+++ Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy. And if you want a girl, I can be a girl. I can be anything you want me to be!
+++$+++ "Hell up here?" Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
+++$+++ The blast? Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
+++$+++ Good.
+++$+++ You got a light, honey?
Some time.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
I thought ten years.
Amen.
Yes, dear, I know.
--do as I say!
--and we will--
Well, I am the head of this household--
We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Excuse me.
We do?
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
I don't believe it!
No.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans. Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that literally and I mean right now!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Just open the door.
I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey?
In the generator room again?
Would you excuse me?
Yes...
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
What did you wish for, Adam?
No kidding. Who else would have done it?
Get the presents and do the lights.
Calvin!
Hi, honey!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Watch this!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Why?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Calvin?!
If I...you know...
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
What shall we call him?
No, Calvin. Babies cry.
Honey?
What?
I told you! I've got everything!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Really?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Burnt to a crisp. I've given you the most well-done cut.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
To go up.
Then after that it's safe.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
The locks.
To you maybe.
As long as we've got that straight.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Days??
How long will we have to stay down here?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
You hear that?!
No. They all do.
It shuts off automatically.
It's time.
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Well, put it down and come in!
For Pete's sake, Calvin! We've got guests!
Stop it, you two!
Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Your stuff? Let me see that.
What are you doing here?
Stop!
Adam!!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? I want to go home.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
We came back to the house!
To get some frozen poultry.
I don't know. I like to think so.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. Damn!
We'll find him.
Give it back to him.
Fallout shelter.
Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome!
What?!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Coward!
You're goddamn right I am!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What?!!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Where did he get all that information?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What?
Or have perfect table manners.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
To bed.
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.
What's it to you?!
We did not leave together.
Uh..he might of.
Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
It's not so much what you say but how you say it. Women like men who are unpredictable.
Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Eve?!
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Just be yourself.
That water's freezing!
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
I think...it...works.
What do you think, Adam?
Alright, I will.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you?
Well, that's blunt!
What's that supposed to mean?
Money is no object. He's got cards up the wazoo.
Exactly. You understand that, don't you? You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Oh, my God...
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
I knew you'd like him.
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Buy it from me?
I'm selling this place. I want out of this hell hole!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Tower, say again!!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Stand by. One.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
+++$+++ Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
+++$+++ Okay honey.
+++$+++ I've seen a few.
+++$+++ Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
+++$+++ I'm not sick.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Yeah. How's Dad?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Certainly Frank. Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Frank. Come in.
+++$+++ Not yet.
+++$+++ Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
+++$+++ For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
+++$+++ You're all through with this now?
+++$+++ Who knows you have these?
+++$+++ Is Sandy part of this?
+++$+++ Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
+++$+++ Okay?
+++$+++ Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
+++$+++ Jeffrey! Come on in.
What color is it?
What is this? What color is it?
+++$+++ I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
+++$+++ Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ The criminals are winning.
+++$+++ Okay.
+++$+++ If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
+++$+++ Jeffrey?
It must be great.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
+++$+++ Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
+++$+++ By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Are you Detective Williams?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Don? Where is he?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
They hurt his head.
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
No. Hi baby.
You look beautiful to me.
What?
I'll call you.
I want you to stay with me.
No. Not really. But also because I really want you to be alright.
Yes.
You called me Jeffrey.
Dorothy. No!
I'm glad you do.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You what?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I love you Don with all my heart.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Sometimes I think I do.
Do you love me?
Kiss me.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Beeeee careful.
Does that scare you?
Frank would open you.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You like to open me, don't you?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
What do you want?
Whatiya mean?
I'm doing it.
Sure I do.
That's good.
I sure don't hate you.
Frank is coming?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Hello.
Please, please stay.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Don? Are you in with them?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Who's it, you mean.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Oh shit.
I liked being with you last night.
I looked for you in my closet tonight. It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Hi, can I come in?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
You don't?
Do you know?
What?
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Do you like me?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Don?
Sure I'm alright.
Don't. I don't like that. What do you want?
No.
Yes.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No. Come on.
Never before this.
Then you got undressed.
Well.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Nobody.
I wanted to see you.
Jeffrey nothing.
Jeffrey.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Yes? What is it?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Oh he forced you, huh?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick. Hey, pretty, pretty.
If you want to.
Those are my breasts.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Then, shut up!
You want to see him too, right?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
From the neighborhood? Shut the fuck up. You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Who's this fuck?
Mommy's here.
My bourbon.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Nothing.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Hey? You like to walk.
Here's to Ben.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Go where?
No thanks. What does that mean?
Speak to me Fucker.
Good, let's drink up.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Okay Frank.
+++$+++ You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
+++$+++ Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
+++$+++ Of course, Jeffrey.
+++$+++ Alright.
+++$+++ Do you want the car?
+++$+++ Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
+++$+++ It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
+++$+++ He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
+++$+++ Jeffrey, when you see your father.
+++$+++ I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Be right down.
This is it.
Mom.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
+++$+++ I'll get a coat for her.
+++$+++ Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
+++$+++ Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
That sounds great!
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
+++$+++ He comes over to study.
+++$+++ It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
+++$+++ Would you like a piece of cake?
+++$+++ I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
+++$+++ Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
+++$+++ Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Good deal Dad.
How ya doin' Dad?
+++$+++ Good to see you, son.
Are you feeling okay?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Hi Dad.
Look Jeffrey.
No Jeffrey!!
Go ahead!
Go ahead.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Probably not. No. Why?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Dorothy Vallens?
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
My father has a gun at home.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
You want to dance?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
I can't dance fast.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
You look beautiful.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Where to?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Just some fatherly advice.
Okay.
I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
You didn't tell him about me?
Everything okay?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yeah.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
What am I going to do?
You were late.
Goodnight.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, Sandy.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
That's what I thought.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yes.
Actually. I've been in twice.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
He got a little jealous.
Well. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Okay, okay. Bye.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay, yeah, call.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
OK.
Yeah, but.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
That sounds good.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Yeah.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Let's go.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I'm here, aren't I?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I don't know.
Yeah. Good bye.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I've gotta go in.
What happened to him?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
What else is new? Right?
How is Central these days?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, how did you know?
Stop it Mike.
Okay.
Sure, just a sec. Excuse me.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
You can change it if you want to.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Oh fuck!
Up where?
Just for him?
What did he bring him in for?
There's ways around that.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
I need Il Duce.
Hey, I just...
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Aye.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry. My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
What?
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Look under the body.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Yes sir.
We're here brother.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
What? What, that guy?
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
C'mon!
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
I-I'll tip her.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
You sound real remorseful.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Anybody you think is evil?
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Chest pocket. Shit!
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Well, there's my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Well, I didn't but...
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
How's Uncle Sibeal?
No ma! No!
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
Ma, what's wrong?
Mother, is that you?
Hello.
Be careful.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Our mother can see through bags.
Know any other languages?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We... met them last night.
Ass!
Fuck!
Right.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
What are you going to do?
We're alive.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Now, you will receive us.
He isn't to be touched.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Give the guy a shot.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
So what do you think?
Who did you kill?
Yes.
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Nine bodies.
Oh, we're good man.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
That was way easier than I thought.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
Where the fuck are you going?
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
A bit.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
What?
For what?
...so that which is good may flourish
No pictures, either.
Spanish. Then I guess he's just real... real good.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Oh, Jesus.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
How many?
Aye.
Aye.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Rule of thumb?
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? Theories.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Of course they were. How many?
Can she I.D. them?
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
And number three, Dolly.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
It was... It was...
Pee...Per...Man.
My, my...
You killed my... my...
You... oh god, why?
Where's my cat?
Rocco!
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
No way they could have seen it?
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
What about one guy with two guns?
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
The Greeks. The Italians.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
And the pennies?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
The what man?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
So what are you thinkin' here?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Witness?
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?! They sure as fuck did!
Shit! Shit!
Eight.
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Who the...
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch. What's your name?
We promise.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Just called ta torture us did ya?
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
I...
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
We have to go now. We're on the lamb.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
I mean he ain't here.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Worst day of my life, man.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
So?
Y'know it is, a bit.
You sure you killed them?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Hurry the fuck up!
No. You sure you're okay?
Roc. You okay?
Hello?
No. You sure you're okay?
Roc. You okay?
Hello?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Right now.
Forgive me father.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
You know them personally?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
You feel?
You believe?
God's permission? God doesn't...
What is it my son?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Hello? You there?
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father. Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Have you no fear of God?
Don't do this my son.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Yes.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
The... The funny man.
Yeah boss?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Scale the --
Dignan, I --
What?
Dignan, I --
How?
You're kidding.
He stole a tractor.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Behind Bob's house.
Oh, I'd say about --
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Nothing.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
Why?
You think Applejack knew?
Pretty much everything.
I'm not kidding.
Yeah.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I'll get him.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Come on, Kumar.
Let's go. Come on.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Where's Kumar?
Who tripped the alarm?
Help me move him.
Nobody move!
Applejack! What's happening?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
What's happening? What's going on?
I don't know.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Take your second position.
Hang on a second.
Roger.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
So do I.
Yeah. As a girl.
Do you like Inez?
He was a nice guy.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't think you will.
Did that hurt?
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
It's like we've finally arrived.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
OK. Mark that down.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Shit, Dignan.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Get out of the way.
Bob!
He seems pretty good.
Let me feel that.
Right now.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
I want you to look at this.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Ah. Couple days ago.
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
That's what she is!
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
How much?
Where's the rest?
Sixteen dollars.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Our money situation is not good.
I'm not. But there's --
I think we better go home.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Shh.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I don't think we can do that.
What?
We need a car.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I wish I'd been there.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Why don't you come with us.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
If you say so.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
You were asleep.
This morning.
That's a long time to be in jail.
He went back for his brother.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Right here.
He's gone. He stole the car.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
This was in fourth grade.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Bob?
As long as he gets out OK.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
No kidding.
On the left.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
What. What's the matter?
Sure.
Jerry. And this is my associate Cornelius.
Hi.
No. We didn't.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
True.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Bob?
On your marks... Get set go.
I'll say it.
You were spoiled rotten.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Look at the treads on those.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Well, then cut it in half.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Why not?
Can I get that credit card from you?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
What's wrong with him?
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like he meant it.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
We got it. We got it.
Unlock that door. Check the aisles.
We know there's another stocker.
Where's the other stocker?
You're right. You're right.
Dignan! Stop!
Dignan, calm down.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
You think we're going to be chased?
Just turn right here.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
That's not bad.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Yeah, I heard that.
No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
I'm lookout.
Did you see that?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
What do you think the cops have?
She's an attractive older woman.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
This is he?
What does Starsky say?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Why?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
OK. That's wrong.
Making Hutch David Soul?
What color hair does he have?
Why'd you want to help us?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
+++$+++ It's an esoteric journey.
+++$+++ But you're thieves. It's what you are.
This is good.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
No. Bob did.
Death.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
I don't want to die.
Me?
That sounds like Dignan.
How'd he do?
Did Dignan take the test?
+++$+++ How does that feel?
That was a test?
What do you mean?
+++$+++ Hold it.
+++$+++ As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business? You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
+++$+++ Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here.
+++$+++ I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
+++$+++ Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
+++$+++ Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
You mean a safecracker?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean like techniques?
+++$+++ Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
+++$+++ You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
+++$+++ That's a sharp jacket.
+++$+++ This is my business manager, Rowboat.
It's in the driveway.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Yeah.
Jesus, Bob.
Let me see it. Did you drop it?
What are you doing?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
It was stupid.
Jesus Christ! No.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
No, I don't mind.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Why not?
Bob, where you going?
What?
Anthony, I --
How long are they going to hold him?
You think he got my license plates?
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Move.
Phil probably provoked him. Where's he going?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
See you.
Are you serious?
Let them fight.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Future Man.
Like silk?
God, yes. Like silk.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Were you born in Mexico?
No.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
How do you say nineteen?
The front stairs.
Feel this.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Yeah.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Wait. Did he see us?
What's he doing here?
That's your friend Anthony?
Wait a second.
Is that Buckethead?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
The one and only Little Richard.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Are you a fag?
Wait a second --
Hold on --
Do they let you --
Do you have your own cell?
Do you have your own room?
What's that?
Run. Run. Let's go.
He's stuck between two floors.
The elevator broke.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
I think so.
Let's go!
What's wrong with Applejack?
I couldn't hear anything.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Everything OK?
Scarecrow?
I know it, man. Hang on.
Look. We want you on the job.
That's OK.
I didn't have any choice.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Bob, you're lying!
You said 48 hours!
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Dignan.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
What's his name?
What is it?
You don't even know his name.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Watch me.
I'm going back.
Come on, Dignan.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
We'll have to see when we get back.
I don't know.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
They said he's a drug dealer.
The weed.
My brother's in jail.
See you in a little while.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
It's registered in my mother's name.
I don't know.
He wouldn't move.
There were more than that.
So it's my fault?
Way to go, Bob!
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't want to talk about it.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
No. I was calm.
Don't count it.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool. Make that light.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
God DAMMIT.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
OK.
That's my responsibility.
I'm going to take a look at this.
I think we might of scared her.
Where'd she go?
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I warned you, Dignan.
I told you he's crazy.
I can't believe you said that.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
OK, Bob.
You stole a Trans-Am.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Let's cut the bullshit.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
So who's going to know?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
Not even for emergencies?
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
+++$+++ Right. I'm sorry. You've got a reputation to think about.
+++$+++ I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
+++$+++ I might have mentioned it.
+++$+++ Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I'm working on it.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
He said what?
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
You keeping out of trouble?
How you doing, Bob?
Ground defense.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
26 weeks.
+++$+++ No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
+++$+++ Join the party, fellas.
Is he good?
Oh, yeah.
The grammar?
What do you mean grammar?
+++$+++ Is he in?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
What can we do?
What's the story?
Why did he go that way?
Where did he go?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Well, I left some money in there.
Where's that guy going?
No, it's not.
Come on in!
How's the weather down there?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
You Hoto?
Fight. You know.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
She is a good looking woman.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
You a good pool player.
You like Chicanos?
No, my friend knows her.
No. I just have short hair.
+++$+++ Nice to meet you.
+++$+++ Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Good to know you, John.
Bourne comes here? Why?
What?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
You told me Bourne was dead.
No. You lost your way.
No good options left?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I'm sorry, Ward.
Don't know.
No... It must have been Bourne.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
What?
Sorry to wake you.
It's hard to swallow. The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick. What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her? You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Berlin!
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
May I finish?
Excuse me.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too. It had to be done.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened. You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
I want to know about Treadstone.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
Never heard of it.
Okay...
Nobody. You. I had to tell you, right?
Including Landy... She had access to the archives.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here... First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this. Bourne would know.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
She say what time I should call?
Sir...
Is this really happening?
No. Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I can't let you do that either.
Look at me.
You know I'm not.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You killed them.
I killed them.
That's not what happened to your parents.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
I would want to know. I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer. That's why I came here.
Sit. Can you... [The chair. Have the chair.]
-- what? --
-- car keys?
I'm sorry.
I did.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I don't know who that is.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
He's dead.
What do you want?
So why didn't you kill me then?
You still should've moved.
Front. Use your teeth.
Felt a little light.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
I only dream about people who are dead.
I know it's a dream.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
But you found another choice.
Tell me later.
There's no choice.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- not yet --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Switch! You drive!
You drive.
-- where's left to go? --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Where --
That's crazy.
So...
But you're sure?
But we were so careful.
No... How?
But it ends up the same.
I should be better by now.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I worry when you get like this.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway! You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
No. There's nothing new.
Conklin up front.
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
No... Jason... please...
That's a lie!
My first job.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
So when was I here?
Abbott?
Why are you here, then?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files? WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
And you got to him before we could.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
I want to hear it from you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Why is she trying to kill me?
You hear me? I believed you.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Yes.
Why you're alive? You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive. Because we want you back on our side.
Sounds like a threat.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Why am I alive?
Oh, shit...
Where am I?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Who?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
What do you want?
It's me.
What? The tapes?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
Alright... take it down.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- go -- take the van! --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Looks like he's been detained.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint... That's from the one that didn't go off.
We need to get in there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Is there. Is all there.
Now. Show now.
Show me.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Still...
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
How long have you worked for the agency?
Who's this?
Felt promising. It's a start.
Let's give him half an hour.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
You mean, did I want a date?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
If you say so.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
And what about you, anything?
Are we hacking or asking?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
By who?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Are we locked up?
Anything?
Yup... The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we? Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et -- ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
I don't want to leave.
He has already agreed to come.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Peace?!
A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
He will. I know he will.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
Does anyone know his politics?
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Wallace has sacked York!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
What news of the north?
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
You fancy him.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
What is it?!
Keep these. We're going too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
That's just a dream, William!
I don't want to be a martyr.
You know it's a trap.
I rest.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Aye.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Fourteen? --
Hamish, I... thank...
I should'a remembered the eggs.
I will not.
I could crush you like a roach.
That depends on the man.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
You win.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
It's up to us, Hamish!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Three, maybe more!
They're coming!
We don't split up!
A patriot!
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
Let her speak.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Humbly, M'lord.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
No. He did not.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Where is my son?
I do not confess.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Treason. Against whom?
Then when?
Tonight then.
I've missed you.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
You scare me.
Nor I!
I... accept your proposal!
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
You are. And I'll come again.
Thank you for inviting.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
And I with you. But you must wake.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
...I wouldn't know.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
It does me good to see you.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
That is not possible.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
It's battle I want, not talk.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
And I will consult with mine.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Who would do such a thing?
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
We can't stop!
What?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
What is it?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
+++$+++ The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
So what did you find.
+++$+++ Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
How soon?...
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
But you must have something to go on?
And the bad news?
+++$+++ It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
+++$+++ A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
+++$+++ Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
+++$+++ Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
+++$+++ And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Just. Like. Jason.
How. Did you. Know that?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Fix?
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Cute, Evan.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
I don't know. These things take time.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please, mom. People will talk.
I... I blacked out.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Great. I'll see you soon.
My father has a bad memory, too?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Can't he come out for one day?
Um... can dad come this time?
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
We're gonna be late again.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Straight up.
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
+++$+++ You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
+++$+++ Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
+++$+++ Books?
+++$+++ Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
+++$+++ This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
+++$+++ It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
+++$+++ The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
+++$+++ Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
+++$+++ Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
+++$+++ Are you hurting her?
+++$+++ Where are you now?
+++$+++ Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Dad lives here?
+++$+++ Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.
Get out. Both of you.
Huh?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Are you stupid or what?
What the fuck are you doing?
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Like Ozzy.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Then you think it might have worked out?
And...?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
I don't get it.
I was?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Is something the matter?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Which is?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
I just thought you should know.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Oh? There's proof now?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Because you're... different.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
What's happened to you?
Ha! Where's that?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
He's a fucking maniac!
What?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
I walk differently?
Like how?
What do you mean?
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Why are you doing all this for me?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
So it didn't feel... weird?
I dunno. Just being weird.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Where... where are my clothes?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're... Incredible.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
I know, but...
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
I've stopped a hundred times.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Hi, Lenny.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Duck, here they come.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
I deserve a lot worse.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Ouch.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Oh God... what did we do?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
+++$+++ That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
+++$+++ Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
+++$+++ ...yes.
+++$+++ Who -- who are you?
+++$+++ What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
+++$+++ It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Kayleigh? What happened?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
We'll find out soon enough.
+++$+++ The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
+++$+++ And you are...?
+++$+++ Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
+++$+++ Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Hey, I got no choice.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Come on, go on...
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Smells like sex in here.
So what's the point?
Destroy it?
What?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
You knew the whole time, didn't you? When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Gee, thanks friend.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
What's wrong with you?!
What happened?? Where are we?!
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Sorry. Never heard of her.
Meant no offense.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Just get out, didja?
Shut up, Tommy!
Lenny? Come on!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Here you go, buddy.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Oh, yes, please.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
He always has.
And you want to know --
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Does he know that?
Yes, I'll bet.
So you decided to go to America.
How long have you been married?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
I should have known.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Yes?
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
A champagne cocktail, please.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
What is your name?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
-- Tonight he forgot.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Come up here a minute.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I won't.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
No thanks, Carl.
That's all right.
Here you are.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
I'd better be going.
Here's to you, sir.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
The bourbon. The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Suppose we do.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
It's not for sale at any price.
It's not for sale.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Good day.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Rick?
Do you know where they are?
Yes, something.
Well, good luck. But be careful. You know you're being shadowed?
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
And the other alternative?
What are they?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Occupied France?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
You needn't be concerned about me.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
But Richard, no, I, I --
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
I don't understand. What about you?
But why my name, Richard?
Everything is quite all right.
No, not yet.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
No.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
How did you get in?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
You can believe that if you want to.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Especially tonight.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
All right. At a quarter to five. Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Looking for a job.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Yes?
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
A franc for your thoughts.
We said "no questions."
He hasn't played it in a long time.
I will.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
No.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, I'm ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Of course, I'll be careful.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
I love you very much, my dear.
I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Ilsa, I --
Ask me?
Did he give any reason?
Yes?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
We'll discuss it later.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yes, I would.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I will, don't worry.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Won't you join us?
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
You're saying this only to make me go.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I... were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
He came from Paris with Rick.
Sam?
Here it is.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes, rather.
Thank you.
My wife?
I beg your pardon?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
My office.
Go ahead.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam. I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Good evening.
Good morning.
We'll come again.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Thank you. I try.
What for?
Won't you join us for a drink?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
How do you do?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I believe you have a message for him?
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
We'll be there.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
My bill.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
No, Captain, please.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Yes. What is it you want?
Yes.
Good day.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
You will give us the names?
Even in Berlin.
And that is?
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
This is hardly the time or the place.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
What is the meaning of that phone call?
But I have no excuse to close it.
But everybody's having such a good time.
I see what you mean.
A leader, like Laszlo?
And if it should change?
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Mademoiselle.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Ho, diplomatist!
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
I expected no less, Captain.
Thank you.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Good evening, Captain.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
What else, my dear Major?
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Our expenses?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
I think perhaps you're right.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
You think of everything, don't you?
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I have. Sit down over there.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Sam's piano.
I have the letters right here.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Yeah? Why?
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Huh?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans? Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Oh, it's my party.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, how do you do?
Yeah, you were saying?
I have my orders.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
He'll take one.
Why two?
Okay.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
His escape.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Victor Laszlo?
Yeah? What's his name?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Perhaps not.
Our entertainment is enough.
A wise foreign policy.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
What, again?
Huh!
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
The clipper to America.
The plane to Lisbon. You would like to be on it?
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
Hello, Louis.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Sacha, she's had enough.
I never make plans that far ahead.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Put it down!
Put that phone down!
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
What is your nationality?
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Rick! Rick, help me!
I don't want them here overnight.
For how long?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
-- You thought what?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Hello Ugarte.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
You said it! Here's looking at you, kid.
Yes, boss.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
No, I don't.
Just a little something of my own.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Shut up and go home, will you?
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Then don't have a drink.
Good. Then have a drink.
No.
No.
Not right now.
Yeah?
Sorry.
He'll double what I pay you.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Nobody remembers that.
It's bad.
Six kilometers. Four miles.
Shut up. I don't feel like dying today.
Then we've just got shit.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day? The next day we just start over again.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Look again, asshole. It's a mirage.
You are.
Shut up.
I'm serious. I'm always going on about me, me, me. Enough about me. Your turn.
Damn it! Don't be so negative!
They're on autopilot.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel. With Kelly.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Yeah, sure, what?
That's death knocking, knocking on your door. Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Got to fix the sea anchor. Use the sail.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
No!
They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
What are you doing?
You're beautiful. Marry me.
Fix raft first.
I'm putting it off.
Moon's too bright.
Polaris, where are you? Maybe I'm too far south.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
No.
No.
No more water, you said.
Do too little you'll die.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
You've had today's water.
Get up, damn you.
Get up.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying. Solution, fix rope.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Sure.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
You are. Yes you are. What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
I can't believe this. I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist. You're into something very powerful. Primal. Truly.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Oh? You've tried?
Yeah. A long time ago.
Hmmm. Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Want to come in? Get dry for a minute.
You know what happened to this?
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed. You never gave up.
You came on a bicycle? No wonder it's so late.
I've got lots of time.
Must be a story there.
You? Personally?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
You too.
I had to come. To be sure you were okay.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
What will you do?
You okay?
This is so unfair.
You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Come on. Try.
The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived.
The plane went down. My friends died. I washed up on an island. Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
That about sums it up.
What was inside?
There was a coffin?
What's that, written on the sail?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that?
Is that Jango?
You have any children?
I would have done the same thing.
I know.
I thought you might have.
A few things came up. Or went down.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
Get back? From where?
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I burned the Christmas tree.
I'm sorry about the presents. I got a little carried away.
There isn't any us.
That's your dog.
No.
"We're" not over-reacting.
This isn't working out.
I have to.
Look, I love the puppy. I love you. But I have to go.
A ring. I wanted a ring.
For when I travel?
And for you --
I can't even keep fish alive.
He is a cute thing.
Hey, look at you.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Four four. A record.
Merry Christmas eve.
What do you want me to say? That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit? That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?
I thought I did.
Cold.
Let's take a look.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Terrific. Yours?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Doc, I'm not on the island. I'm not on the raft. I'm alive. I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you. I just want out of here.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
If you say you are.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach. It's almost like schizophrenia. Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat. Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good. Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Yeah.
Sure.
I used to drive one of those. A long time ago.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Need some help?
Come on down to the plant. It's state of the art. We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
But chickens?
Thought you were going to bring her.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord. Amen.
What a journey you've had. It seems more than a person should have to bear.
I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Roger got me on. I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back. I would have come to Memphis, but --
There's settled folks, and there's nomads. You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
I'm doing fine.
Don't you even think about it.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home. We bring out the store bought.
That new roof, that's your doing.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Mom, meet Jango.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.
Hmmm. Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
What about the sender?
Kamal, you're breaking up. Can you hear us?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
What's going on down there?
Who is this? Where is Kamal?
No sweat.
Finish what you started. You haven't changed, Chuck. It's still you.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do.
What, then?
Not just that. Take your time. Use it. Live it.
That's what it's about.
Take your time.
Digital laser readers.
That's all there is.
To life. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
I'm serious. The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
You've been over the line and you came back. You've been saved, hallelujah!
To Wilson.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You were how long on this?
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Cool ropes.
This stinks really bad.
How about we go somewhere else?
Hello.
I beat the odds!
You're fucking dead!
God damn! God damn! Chuck, it's you!
Hello?
Malaysia's tanking. We're meeting in ten in operations.
Talk is cheap. Are we on or not?
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
I'm trying to help you here. There's Warsaw, there's this --
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow. That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not. That's why you're not married and I am.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys. We've got to be bold. You always want all your ducks lined up. But nothing's 100 percent. It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60. Then roll the dice.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right. Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while? So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane. But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
You know what your problem is? You just see the packages in front of you. You don't see the big picture.
What? Let Paris hold its plane? Let Memphis take care of it? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
I'm touched.
But I might not have.
It was fifteen minutes late.
Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change.
Borrowed. I borrowed it.
No please, join me. Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Dr. Homer Wells.
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
These *credentials* are against the law!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He'll need clothes... some money...
They just want you to hire some new help.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You weren't dreaming about me.
Life is waiting.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
I doubt it. She's just an...
I know.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
And that I can drive a truck!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Why not?
I mean your parents.
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, Daddy.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Do you think she'll be all right?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
"...did." Well, okay.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Please don't make me say it again.
He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.
I know, I'm sorry.
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want...
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Nothing.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
You don't understand! It's her father...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
Olive told me. You might have told me yourself.
*What* will be okay?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
I *know* this was right.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Just a little privacy.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
You don't miss it?
At least you were never lonely.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
What's the *medical* explanation?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
She *did* love him! How many women have you known?
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
"King Kong". It's really good.
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
People watched the movies in their cars?
A movie *outside*?
I better go.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
So. Not bored yet?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
I'm a little worried about the... ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Burma!
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I've never seen the ocean, either.
I've never seen a lobster.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
How many months are you?
So, Mrs...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
+++$+++ I can't go nowhere.
Yes, I *have*!
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. I've been through this.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Hi...
+++$+++ How is that Wally doing?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
I love you, Wally.
There! You said it was boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
That's true.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
They wanted a girl.
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
I just wanted to ask you...
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
I don't know! He's just leaving-- you're the one who says he needs to see the world! *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
That's a heavy sedation.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
What's an immigrant?
Did you grow up around here?
What's a nanny do?
Did you know your mother better?
But did you know him?
*Liver* killed him?
Is *your* father dead?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Uh... it's the end of October.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
+++$+++ I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
+++$+++ Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
+++$+++ I don't remember.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering... Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
What about the trees?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons. The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
They're migrants.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
At what altitude?
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Liberator...
What kind of plane are you flying?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Right?
+++$+++ That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
+++$+++ She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
+++$+++ If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
+++$+++ I'm stayin', Homer.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
+++$+++ You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
+++$+++ And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do! I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Is it true?
+++$+++ You still doin' it too fast!
+++$+++ Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
+++$+++ Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
I guess so...
Okay...
Right.
+++$+++ Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't need your gratitude.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
I'm happy I amuse you.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
You do it then.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
It's my turn!
Where's the name sheet?
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
I haven't read that.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"! Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
It's obviously an aborticide.
It looks like scurvy.
There was no visible wound?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Yes, for both.
Right.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
I don't know. Just promise me one thing.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
That's it.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
+++$+++ You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
But you don't look very happy.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
You're not yet three months, are you?
+++$+++ I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Almost.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
I'm not in trouble.
+++$+++ You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Do you like to read?
+++$+++ So what?
+++$+++ What you got a picture of your heart for?
+++$+++ What's that?
Rose Rose?
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
+++$+++ You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
+++$+++ Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
+++$+++ Now, now. He's a good boy.
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
+++$+++ Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
+++$+++ No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Then it's malaria?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
+++$+++ Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar? Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
+++$+++ Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
+++$+++ You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
It look nicer then home!
We see you next harvest.
Sorry, Homer...
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
+++$+++ They told me I was too old to serve.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
+++$+++ Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
+++$+++ Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
+++$+++ Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
What view?
+++$+++ That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
+++$+++ I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
+++$+++ You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
+++$+++ You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
+++$+++ You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
+++$+++ Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
+++$+++ That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
+++$+++ What's lucky about that?
+++$+++ Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
She took off in the night!
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Tough day?
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Two million.
The standard ten.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Let's just slow down for a second...
What's this?
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Everything looks in order.
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
+++$+++ It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
+++$+++ I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
+++$+++ Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
+++$+++ Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Guess so.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Today? Started off great...
She walked.
We were back on.
It's not true.
I was doing it for them.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Keeping the Fix happy.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Grifters...
Just the last three weeks.
Gee... What makes you say that?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Know who I am, Jake?
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
We're going to give him the money back?
Come on...
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
So what? We hide, right?
Mob?
What's a King Pin?
Who's that?
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Moonan. Here. Shit...
I'm going home
Jake...
Masters of our own destiny.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
So that's it...
Jake --
Calls?
You'll be there?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
She up for this?
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
Two million.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Tonight. Just me.
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
You know what we're doing with the money.
Well, this is just fucking great...
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
Shit.
I think I just broke my hand.
+++$+++ Come here!
+++$+++ Come here. Feel this.
+++$+++ Look at you, you skinny prick.
Excuse me?
+++$+++ Listen, Scooter --
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
I need you to stake me.
I think two million.
+++$+++ You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let me see 'em.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
No. Just confidence.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Because you killed one of my crew.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I can't do that.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
You can't cheat an honest man.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Minus one.
I have a good crew.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...? It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Good boy.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
+++$+++ Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
+++$+++ Attractive girl.
+++$+++ What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Help me.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
What do you want? An apology?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
What about what?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
You know why I told you that, Jake? Because I trust you too.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
He was looking out for you.
Glenn talked you out of it.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Sounds respectable.
I SAID, HOW DO -- Deal with that?
How do you deal with --
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you know I will?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
It's more than that.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Do you have something to prove?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Look at you... You want to go.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
I gotta go get a haircut.
He's gone.
Uh... Everything okay?
I don't trust anyone.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
And some new clothes.
You need to get a haircut.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
I'll worry about Customs.
Just play a part. A little acting.
You get an equal cut.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Says who?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy. Jake.
That's not --
What is this? You guys cops or something?
And we got rid of the red head.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
Escorts!
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Where the hell is she?
You sure?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Uh...
Why?
What do we need another Shill for?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
I'm getting a ride.
Meet me at my place later.
Do we want insurance? I'm just asking...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Yeah.
Stop waving that thing around.
Then shut up.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
This is embarrassing.
I know it's policy, but... The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Sorry. What?
What happened?
Stand up.
Egg Foo Young. Stand up.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
You're a weasel.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
What'd he say?
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
I'll find the time.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
So what do you want?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Then who's the Banker?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
A little bit of both.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Aces, Suits.
Just a tip.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
+++$+++ Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
+++$+++ So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
+++$+++ Speak.
+++$+++ A Fed? Is he close?
+++$+++ Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
We're here.
Let's just say he burned me once.
Did he buy it?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Special Agent?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Peace of mind.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card. Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
Who?
High five.
I'm down!
It's just insurance.
You trust this Moonan guy?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
To who?
A couple I know are getting married.
You're all scumbags.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Ouch.
Not like Matt, you mean.
The Indian rope-trick.
I despise the job.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I got scared.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M. No blow jobs. No screwing.
I hate cheats.
You're shaking.
I'll take you up on that.
My car's in the garage.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
Is it that bad?
Jack Manfred.
Seven-fifty.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
How about five hundred.
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
What kind of deal you looking to?
How's that football story corning along?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
And your lady?
Good night?
Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating?
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
I don't gamble.
Who was he?
South African women are very sporty.
Looking forward!
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here... It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business. Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Habib?
I'm working on that soccer story.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
All right. As what?
Hi-ya... I'll call you back. Now then...
Did she? You were pretty thick at one time.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
How can anyone be that naive?
What?
Why did you take the money?
Leave me alone, Marion.
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
Nothing about you.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
How did you know I was here?
Really?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
You were talking in your sleep.
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
I'll leave the casino soon. I promise.
You're entitled to your opinion.
That girl, she works at the casino --
I hope it brings you luck.
No. Answer it!
The door, Jack.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
It's the truth.
Marion. It's a book.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Why not?
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
What are you doing here? You know the rules.
You're my conscience.
Marion, stop this.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Probably.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
I'll see you in my dreams.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Poor baby. This'll relax you.
You're shaking. What is it?
How did it go?
What's the time?
Are you trying to read my palm?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I start Monday week.
I had training. In the Republic.
It came my way. 450 a week.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
I've got a job.
I've got something to tell you.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Where did you get it?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I won't be that long.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I couldn't resist them.
+++$+++ Don't let yourself down.
+++$+++ Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good. I love you Jacko, you know that
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
+++$+++ I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
+++$+++ Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
No.
Great.
Did you solve your problems?
How are you?
Jani! Where are you?
Hello...
I don't think we should meet again.
Would you like a drink?
And your hand too.
Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Do you?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Thank you.
Is it yes?
What for?
I told you, all bets are off.
Let it go.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
I want you to forget what I said.
I can't do it, Jani.
What about my neck?
Reynolds? You've done your research.
What ten thousand pounds?
But if it does.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
And I thought you were only after my body.
You're serious.
Robbery's not criminal?
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Who's they?
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
I know that. But you can now.
I owe a lot of money.
I'm in trouble.
I didn't.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
Which side do you like?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
I'll watch.
That's fine.
Turn left ahead.
How did you hurt your hand?
Toss you for it.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off. I must go. Let me pay for this.
Do you believe in astrology?
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Near the casino.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
To coincidence.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Well, thank you anyway.
You know where I'm from?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Of course I recognised him!
Ross.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Where to?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Have I?
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight. Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
What happened to Bella?
Rough day?
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I don't gamble.
No thanks.
That bitch? No.
Good call. Help yourself.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
What are you, a cop?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Some other time.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.
She's my baby.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Over the river.
It was you, you shit.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
I put them on together.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
How do you feel, Jack?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I can see.
He's a good customer.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
I just want the job.
That hair will have to go.
You can start Monday week.
Very impressive.
No.
Yes.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
Ever?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
You want me to check?
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Five.
Five.
You won't. Not without permission.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
I don't think so.
They've been tested.
We do.
Give me 365.
Any exceptions?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
We check every four days.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
I was at Beadles.
No.
Has he?
Jack.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Doolittle, are you there?
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Oh, God...
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Where's the fail-safe key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
The key!
What's he doin'?
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Yeah.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
-- open quantum latches --
I read the same here.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
All right, then...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Time to start talking.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Arm yourself, bomb.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock. All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years. Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Hey, bomb...
Snap out of it, bomb.
+++$+++ The only thing which exists is myself.
+++$+++ False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
+++$+++ Therefore, I shall ignore you.
+++$+++ You are false data.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Do you remember the detonation time?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
+++$+++ I have no proof that it was false data.
+++$+++ ...nine seconds...
+++$+++ Hmmm...
+++$+++ True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
+++$+++ I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
+++$+++ Yes, well...
+++$+++ Of course not.
+++$+++ That is correct.
+++$+++ To explode, of course.
+++$+++ Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
+++$+++ Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
+++$+++ Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
+++$+++ In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Right!
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
But how do you know you exist?
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Oh, sure.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
-- automatic channels open --
-- open circuit breakers --
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Veil nebula.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Wha?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Commander Powell would have named it.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
What are you gonna name it?
Any of 'em any good?
Any planets?
Which one?
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Doolittle...
Yes, Doolittle.
I'll check it.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Mafhkin oble groop...
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Yeah?
No kidding?
Phoenix?
Oh yeah?
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I like it up here.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Phenomenology...
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Talk to the bomb.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Sorry.
Doolittle, hello?
Well, what you might try is --
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
It didn't work?
What was that, Doolittle?
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Ah... pity, pity...
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
This.
Okay, okay. I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
No?
Yeah.
Bruno's girlfriend.
This won't hurt. Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D. Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
Who's Camille?
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient. It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down. Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job. Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
That's not why we're here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Sooo...whattya think? Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date. Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Yeah?
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works. You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Guess again.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras. He wants you to come see him.
Move it.
Can I say something in my defense?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Could you give us a moment.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank. You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
+++$+++ 'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
+++$+++ You mean until you showed up?
Don't look down.
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
Out there.
Lemme put some clothes on.
It's a sweep. C'mon.
What is it?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you. But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
Why would I be pissed?
What're you lookin' at me for? I'm not his next of kin. Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
It concerns only Jah. But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
You're light a deuce.
I'll make it worth your while.
I shouldn't do this. But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power. Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
What're you looking for?
Same old story. Not interested.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Where'd you clip this?
You didn't...
What's with you? Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
What a creep.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did. But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Thanks, it's starting to kick in. I feel almost human.
Hang on, Lauren. We're conferencing in Sophy.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think. If she hears her kid's voice...
What else can we do?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Can you help me get her back?
I couldn't get to her. It all happened so fast. Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run. And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want. If I run, maybe they'll come after me. Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
They took my daughter.
SHHH! Don't do that!
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Soon, baby.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Sophy? Are you okay?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying. But things will be better when we move to a new place.
What makes you cry?
No...
Because we can't. There's nothing here for us anymore.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Goodnight Bears. Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks. And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house. And goodnight--
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover. Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery. He escaped from custody after 4 days. Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes. But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
We're quoting Mom again.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Look, thank you for this but--
Deeds, not words. I need your help.
It turned up on the black market. One of my sources thought I might be interested.
What's this?
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone. Once and for all. It was war, Max, and you won.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do. So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences. Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule. Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Somebody's got to.
That's deep. But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow. They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers. You know who Sonrisa is?
The woman you met, Lauren. She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar. The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
Your help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
Hardly...
A girl.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
How much do you know?
How well do you remember the lab?
The bar code on your neck, Max. I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
You did go through my stuff.
C'mon, Max. First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
The other one like you...
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
You need to get out more.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
Yes on all counts.
We are not fine.
Whoa there, Tex! We've been through all this.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
How do I know you didn't?
Bent.
Completely different situation. I steal things in order to sell them. For money. It's called commerce. But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
You got a lotta nerve.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
I won't be staying.
Yeah...
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Something.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted. And now they don't.
Look around at all this... Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life. Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared. They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands. Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
One of my sources. Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Lauren's not my wife.
Too early to tell.
Now you know who I am, where I live. I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Wasn't that hard.
The one you're wearing?
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Logan Cale.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Whoever that is.
We're just a little tense right now... It's okay.
You're lucky. I almost pulled the trigger.
I was expecting someone else.
Thank God.
You're a thief?
None.
Max something. I got no clue where she stays.
I need to talk to her.
But she does work here?
Know where I can find her?
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
I understand.
Okay, okay.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
This is not a place you wanna go.
I think you should go now.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
And so should you. Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you. I know all about how you threatened him. That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Look, I don't know what you want--
How do I know you're telling the truth?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Who is it?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Got a pencil?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Your fiance has four previous wives. His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off. Which is what you oughta do.
You're crazy.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
How's this about me?
Here's your money.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance. Lemme get the file.
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
What about the other kids? You get anything on them?
She was a nurse. She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the... ...the clinic. There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Nothing on Hannah?
Then what?
He says he got it from a woman. Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing. It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped. So we don't get anything on the seller. Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Right here someplace.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
+++$+++ I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
+++$+++ Only one I can think of.
+++$+++ So are dogs.
+++$+++ Please...
+++$+++ Friends don't help other friends cheat.
+++$+++ Unlikely.
+++$+++ You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
+++$+++ Where?
+++$+++ More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
+++$+++ And back at ya. Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
+++$+++ Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
+++$+++ How long you and me known each other?
+++$+++ You know what I'm saying.
+++$+++ Hell yeah. There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying. You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
+++$+++ He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
+++$+++ You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
+++$+++ What?
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What guys do. 'Nother order.
+++$+++ Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
+++$+++ Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that? Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Morning, Sunshine...
You get it when I get her.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
I have sincere eyes.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this. You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country. I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Pull the cash.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Not right now.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Tell everybody hey.
What if he's on the level?
I know what I got, Max. They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets. Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
You're the best, Maxie.
Shut-up...
Say the words, "I understand."
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish. And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up. Understand?
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Easy Sketchy.
You don't.
I'll give it my best shot.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
How'd you get her out of town?
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
--a philandering pig.
You set up on Lydia. When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up. I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake. One I'll never, ever make again. Natalie and I are soulmates. I know that now. She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed. Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
She's as much as said so. But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
I'm a toy to her.
Lydia.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie. Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Exactly.
Hear me out. This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
I'm the victim here.
But there's another side--
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Max--
I know what you're thinking. But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with. As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much. So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
What's up?
Hey, Sketchy--
Right, the big one-oh.
Quitting time. Grab a cold one?
Catch you back at the wall.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
What about this?
Fourteen-thirteen Market. Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
For a change.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I want you on call here.
This is a hot run. Beat it. You're late.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
More than anything in the world.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
What the hell is that?
Huh?
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Thanks, miss.
I-I c-can't...
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Whoa... she is a killer.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
What's that?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Coming dad. I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Ann Arbor?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Oh, screw it!
We've got to take this slow...
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Believe it.
Yeah?
It's okay.
Thanks.
Whatever... stella.
You got in the car, didn't you?
What? That's disgusting!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Any luck?
One more time in English.
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
What's in Sandusky?
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Namely?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Yeah.
Nah. Couldn't be.
Tickets?
Still too risky for my money. We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got... twenty-five.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
The paint!
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Curly.
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Sunday, but...
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Check!
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
YO, DOOFUS!
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Sure.
Oh, yeah...?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Dude, this is all I got.
Go ahead, Jam.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Cool.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
What's gone?
It's my Bullworker.
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Jam, listen up.
+++$+++ Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Mom, what're we...?
I said, I'm sorry!
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
+++$+++ What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
+++$+++ I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
They're not idiots.
But, mom!
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Ahh, sunshine.
+++$+++ Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Oh, hi, mom.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
That's it?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Let's lift up her shirt.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Hello summer detention.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
We won?!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
+++$+++ You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
+++$+++ Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
+++$+++ It's not nearly enough, punk.
+++$+++ A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
+++$+++ Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
+++$+++ No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
+++$+++ Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
COAT +++$+++ I don't even think you have a gun!
COAT +++$+++ Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
COAT +++$+++ Gimme your gun, boy!
COAT +++$+++ Oh, yeah! You and what army?
+++$+++ Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
+++$+++ I did?
+++$+++ Yeah.
+++$+++ Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
+++$+++ Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
+++$+++ Now that's what I like to hear! Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
+++$+++ Are you AFRAID?
+++$+++ Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
+++$+++ That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
+++$+++ Good morning, mongrels!
Yeah.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
+++$+++ Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
+++$+++ You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
+++$+++ I'm not following you.
+++$+++ That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
+++$+++ Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
+++$+++ Beg pardon?
+++$+++ Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
+++$+++ A metal craft of any kind.
+++$+++ The basic principles of time travel are there. So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
+++$+++ A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
+++$+++ Theoretically.
+++$+++ So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
+++$+++ Donnie.
Donnie! Give it back!
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
I'm telling Mom.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
When can I squeeze one out?
What did you say?
You know what? I think that you did it.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
How much longer is this gonna last?
Why do they call you Frank?
What happened to your eye?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
You have a request?
I want to show you something.
Where did you come from?
Who is... we?
Why did you make me flood the school?
How can you do that?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
How old is Grandma Death?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
Is that a cellar door?
No. Frank.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Come with me.
What?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Did you call the cops?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
My mom is gone.
Hey.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
What do you mean?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
What? How long was I asleep?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
So, we call them... IMGs.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Oh, yeah. "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Who?
Are you okay?
What?
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
You want to kiss me...
And what?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
What happened to your neck?
Why?
Yeah?
And you'd never been there before?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Where are you going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Will you go with me?
I'm sorry.
We never would have had this conversation.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.
Fuck them.
Don't look so freaked.
Wanna walk me home?
Hey...
+++$+++ If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Do you get to meet Ed?
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
That is a terrible nickname.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom. Get out of my room.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
When did you stop taking your medication?
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
I know I'm not the best... communicator. But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool. But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
You're my only son...
Who's been giving you weird looks?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Grandma Death.
Oh, shit!
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Where it came from?
Do they know yet?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
+++$+++ Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away. She was right about the rabbits. Go.
+++$+++ So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Cellar door.
What's "Cellar Door"?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Where are you going?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
+++$+++ Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
+++$+++ Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
+++$+++ And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him? It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
+++$+++ Who is Frank?
+++$+++ Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Thank you.
+++$+++ You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you. And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
+++$+++ If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
+++$+++ Where is he, Donald?
+++$+++ Who is he going to kill?
+++$+++ What is going to happen?
+++$+++ When will this happen?
+++$+++ Then how is time travel possible?
+++$+++ How is that possible?
+++$+++ Where are we going, Donald?
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Because I'm so horny.
I think now that he might...
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
That I did it again.
Regret.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Yes. I went to jail.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
People get hurt.
I... I was playing with fire.
Yes.
+++$+++ Have you ever made love, Donald?
+++$+++ The good stuff.
+++$+++ I know.
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Nothing.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us. I followed my spear... and I found something...
+++$+++ No. That makes you keep searching.
+++$+++ Do you feel alone right now?
+++$+++ Is Callie still around?
+++$+++ How does that make you feel?
+++$+++ A sign from whom?
+++$+++ Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
+++$+++ Can anyone else see him?
+++$+++ How many times have you seen Frank?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think about girls a lot.
Yes.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I met a girl.
Yes.
No. That's stupid.
Into the future. Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
He said to follow him.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Don't you watch the news?
I think he saved my life.
His name is Frank.
So, I met a new friend.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Her name is Gretchen.
I was just being honest.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Because you tell Mom everything.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Yeah.
Guess who wrote it?
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
+++$+++ I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
+++$+++ Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
+++$+++ Excuse me? What's your name, son?
+++$+++ But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
+++$+++ I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
+++$+++ He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
+++$+++ Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
+++$+++ Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
+++$+++ Has your son ever told you about Frank?
+++$+++ What I think is going on with your son.
He died, remember? On the way to the prom. He was doomed.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
You're not a bitch.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
No. I took a year off to be with you. Of course I care. Don't get angry. What?
That's enough.
Donnie? You're a dick.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
I guess they made him do it.
Yep.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
But now you can't go.
Beg pardon?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Kitty...
+++$+++ Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts... Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
+++$+++ I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
+++$+++ The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
+++$+++ I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
+++$+++ And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
+++$+++ Kitty...
+++$+++ Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
No more fuckin' for her.
Raspberry.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Go back to China, bitch!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
I gotta work with these women.
Loretta, don't do that.
Airport Ho-Jo!
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
This came for you, sweetie.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
What is wrong with you?
Thank God for bunge cords.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
You-betcha.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
So, what do I say?
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
You're what?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Where is she?!
Is Mom okay?
Yah?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Your parents'd kill you.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Amber? Here.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Mrs. Leeman?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
I'm gonna need more caps.
+++$+++ Amber...
+++$+++ Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother." The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
It's okay.
Bye mom.
C'mere. I love you so much.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Ow!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Mom!
Go on! Get out!
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
We all do. Now let's go.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
I just did.
You heard me. Where is it?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Yes, Leslie!
Yes...
Yeah...
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Here, have some.
Bye.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Hi...
Annette, just use your hand.
We was robbed.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant! If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
You don't know where this is gonna...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here. Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall." You guys want a beer?
Oh, naw. Hi.
Hi.
You could be quiet.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
The bitch.
Wisconsin.
That bitch from...
Dakota.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Okay?
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
I'm a mirror.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
And the year before that?
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
#1 +++$+++ What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
GIRL +++$+++ Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
GIRL +++$+++ This pageant's like a roach motel.
GIRL +++$+++ Tammy Curry?
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Becky was my only shot at state!
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Oh, all right How soon they forget where all this comes from.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
This is -- what?
What!
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Yeah.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
All right, let's go.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Iris, stop! It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Nothin' too showy!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Harold!
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
+++$+++ What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP! Cut her outta this!
+++$+++ No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
+++$+++ Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
+++$+++ English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong. She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
And wear a crown and everything.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
Yes, sir.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight. Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody. Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan. Yours very truly...
None of your business... Take another letter.
Take a letter...
We'll start a fire -- -- and get rid of these microbes.
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
But you're my father -
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
His Excellency's car!
Here I am, Father...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Take another letter... to my tailor.
That's what I wanted in the first place. Tear it up and send it airmail.
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
That doesn't sound right... take out "President"... now read it.
My dear President... read it back...
Who to?
Here I am, Father.
+++$+++ You haven't been still a moment since you've been here. You act as if you had neurosis --
+++$+++ What's the matter with you?
+++$+++ In her dressing room? Why, what could he be doing there?
+++$+++ Yes -- why?
+++$+++ I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Sure.
Fine. We gotta him.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
That's-a pretty good. I'll take a dozen of them.
Oh, sure. We have horse maneuvers every morning.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's all right. We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Is that so? I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
Why not? You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Late again, eh? You haven't been on time once since this war started... Get out there and fight...
You no gotta no gun.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino. You go right out and get yourself an army.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
She did.
He's-a very easy to insult -- I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
That's a-no good. If I apologize we no got a war. Look -- I send you a scrap of paper. You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
That's a-no good. You gotta insult somebody from another country. Look -- I come from one country. You come from another country. I say something you don't like. You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Sure, that's easy. You gotta insult somebody.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
What do I get?
'At's-a fine.
Look, I'm a very nervous man. I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one. And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't wanna work at all.
That's no good. I like to work on the outside. I must have something easy.
What other job you got?
Hello... Yes... No, not yet... All right... Goodbye. That was for you again. He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
Oh, no -- nothing doing. I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
No, but I shot some ducks.
'At's-a no good. I went to Niagara Falls once.
Sure. How much does the job pay? Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Oh no, I can't do it.
That was for you.
He only weighs ten ounces --
I don't want him.
Yankee Poodle.
I don't call him, I whistle.
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
All right -
I can't do it right away.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
How'm I doing, boss?
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited. I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free. The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it. If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it. The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it. If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it. The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Tired! I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Not at all. When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it. I will stay here in Freedonia.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it. Where's my secretary?
I still like UPSTART the best.
That's it...
No... it was a seven letter word.
No, that wasn't it...
I don't remember.
Nothing doing!! I've taken a lease on the battlefield. I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
Forget? You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
THEN IT'S WAR!
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Then it's war?
You upstart!
You worm!
You swine!
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
What can this mug offer you? Wealth and family. I can't give you wealth... ...but we can have a little family of our own.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine. I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years... If that's not an insult, I don't know what is. Gloria, I love you. I --
You don't understand. This is my niece Vera.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
$50?
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum... I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
+++$+++ The king can do no wrong!
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion -- Not bad, eh?
THIS IS TREASON!! What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
WHAT ?
That's all right. I'll fix you right up.
Take a seat -- you're next.
You can call me Gloria too. Gloria -- what a beautiful name. When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better. The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again. I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight... If the enemy gets those papers we're lost. If they don't get them, we're lost. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you? I love you... Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth. They don't come any better than you...
+++$+++ Oh, won't you reconsider...
+++$+++ But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit... He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place. Maybe you can suggest something.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats... Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
No wonder he passed away. I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me. Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Well, I won't stand for much. And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon. Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling... six in behavior. Now who were the six? A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack... Now what were you saying?
For you, I would do anything...
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
I shall report this indignity the my President. Mrs. Teasdale, I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
+++$+++ Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
+++$+++ Well no -- not exactly -- but --
+++$+++ Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored... But you see - well - I --
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
What is money? Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I thought everything was working out fine.
It is every woman's problem. Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands? Who...
Uncle, you can't do this!
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
I've always thought that myself.
How lovely.
Oh?
Two, please.
Yes please, two.
Oh Frederick.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
More romances for John?
You stay with me.
Yes.
John loves the house.
Well, these things take time.
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
What do you mean?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Did it go well, darling?
You won't be long?
Like this.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
I found it.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Don't!
What are you going to do?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
Right... Right.
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
I want him back!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Never mind that, I want my man!
I want my man back.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die. Head's too heavy.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
He fell. He falls.
I intend to.
What do you mean?
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Please do.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Has the response picked up?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Yes, I think I can.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
And what was that, John?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
...Yes, Sir.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Good! How is the patient?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Good morning, sir.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
What is it, Treves?
...everyone has been very kind.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
Are you comfortable here?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
How are you feeling today?
You never mentioned his mental state.
I don't know what I've got.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
What a mess.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
How long has this man been here?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
No, but I certainly shall.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
You've never been?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Yes.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Yes.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
+++$+++ You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
+++$+++ Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
+++$+++ I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Yes.
You're English.
y-y-yes--
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
...I learned a long time ago.
The main spire.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Thank you... very much.
Yes.
Good morning.
No, nothing.
Thank you very much.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Oh no, I couldn't.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
You did this for me?
...my... home?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
I thought as much.
...Can you cure me?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Good morning.
Here.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Of course.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Oh yes.
Not at all, John.
How is your tea, John?
That's a canopy, John.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
You look splendid, John.
How long will I stay here?
The hospital?
This... is my new home?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
...Yes potatoes... but...
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Righteousness...
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
Mmmerrick.
Mmmerrick.
Merrick...
John... Merrick
My... name is...
Hello...
Yes.
Yes!
Yyess.
...Yyes
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Well...
A dressing bag?
Very smart indeed.
Yes sir. What's that?
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now. That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Won't come out, eh?
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
The workhouse.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I've heard.
Fine.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
HE'S GONE!
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
And who might you be, sir?
+++$+++ Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
But, Father, it IS!
+++$+++ But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
+++$+++ She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
+++$+++ I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
You're losing your temper!
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
There IS no one.
Who, Father?
+++$+++ Open up! I know you're in there!
+++$+++ Open up! I know you're in there!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Then I shall come too.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
Not quite...
The second note to wake the Gods...
Then let go!
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Do you believe I love you?
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
But you don't realize....
Erik. You don't understand.
No!
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Just give me a hand.
Halfdan the Black.
We mustn't let him land!
You're as bad as my father.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
I've never LOVED anybody!
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
But you LOVED her all the same...
What was she like?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
Yes.
Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What are what?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
I said welcome.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
How do we know this is the way?
But... How is it you can see me? You can all see me?
But --
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
I see the world.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
But it IS! Look!
Yes... oh, yes...
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
+++$+++ I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
+++$+++ Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
+++$+++ Don't talk nonsense.
+++$+++ Why?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
You've got to let me go!
Yes?
+++$+++ YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
+++$+++ Well, how d'you think I feel?
+++$+++ They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
+++$+++ Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
+++$+++ We're just not a very musical nation...
No.
Really.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
+++$+++ But you don't want to hear it.
+++$+++ A lot of people like our singing.
+++$+++ You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
+++$+++ What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
+++$+++ Would you like us to sing to you?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
How?
No... we don't...
Why should you care?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Well... no...
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Why?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Why... should YOU care?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Aaagh! Rape!
Ah.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Well you started it.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
You DON'T like it, do you?
About raping me?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
What?
Oh, get it over with.
What -- rape?
You don't love ME.
Sh!
Shut up.
Yes.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Don't you FEEL it?
I know. I know.
He wants to KILL us.
Halfdan the Black's here!
That's terrible!
What's wrong with making friends?
Let's hack her to pieces.
How deep IS the ocean?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
It's Halfdan the Black!
What are you talking about?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
But...
Find it... AND cross it!
That's my boy!
So? What'd you do to her?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Who have you been talking to?
You talking piffle, son?
What?
We're missing all the fun...
Faster!
Slower! In... Out...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
I want to die... No, I don't!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
+++$+++ What did he say?
+++$+++ What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What "magic"?
+++$+++ The sun! That's it!
ROW!
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
+++$+++ You may need a real Berserk.
Look... Erik...
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
So?
Why should WE care?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
No! Arrgh!
I've got you!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
To the oars!
Like fish.
Well, come on!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Now stop it!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
No, don't say anything else!
I think we should go...
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... er... yes...
Nobody gets killed.
There is another way.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
Well, what else do we do?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
What do you think?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Wait, Erik!
I came to find my grandfather.
Sven!
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Hy-Brasil?
She hasn't got any.
ROW!
I AM one, Dad!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
I was sitting there.
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
We'd be the first!
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
I will join my grandfather there.
Please.
What d'you expect me to do?
Yeah... well...
Bye, Leif.
+++$+++ He hasn't.
+++$+++ Do what?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
It can't do you any HARM...
What's all the panic about?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
You know, my son, our lord said...
Same thing, isn't it?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You're wasting your time.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
That's it!
Bastard.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
I know. I know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
No, I'm not.
Hang on...
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
What are you talking about?
Got you!
What have you got there?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Oh...
Who's that?
Well! Come on!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
Like you got rid of Snorri!
You fool!
You've lost your mind.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Shut up!
Help!
Help!
I'm drowning! Help!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
YOU do it!
How can we stops him now?
Well... I... I thought...
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
That's right.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
Can't make enough swords!
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
+++$+++ I hate you! I hate you!
+++$+++ And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
+++$+++ He drove me mad!
There is nothing we can do...
+++$+++ Well, go on! Go berserk!
+++$+++ There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, of course he is!
+++$+++ HOLD it! HOLD it in!
KILL! KILL!
I must KILL! Kill!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
+++$+++ You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
+++$+++ But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
+++$+++ So did my father and his father before him.
+++$+++ I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
+++$+++ I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
+++$+++ It's a tradition.
No... he's not... not... there...
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Me too.
Neither am I.
You liar!
I never do...
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
No, Mother.
Yes, Mum.
Yes, Mother.
No one.
I told you that later.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
I did. You said, things were fine.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
Say hi to Naomi.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Sweetie, we called the company.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
No, it was lovely.
And I just liked you so much.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Okay, I guess.
Hi.
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
May I help you?
What's wrong with me?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
In the world.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
You rat.
Come over after I'm done here?
You were not.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Okay, I guess.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I don't know.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you were a bully...
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Have sex. Y'know --
Listen, did you want to make love?
I think I should go back.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
When?
So you'll call me, right?
Bye, Joel.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
No, it's our house! Just tonight -- -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
What are you doing?
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Male or female?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Um, no.
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Seems too coincidental that way.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think she's great.
I love her.
Okay.
yeah?
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Oh God, how horrid.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You said...
Hi there.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I remember that speech really well.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Well, you're married.
Yeah?
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Is that what you want?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Come up and see me... now.
And I didn't have an argument.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
But you weren't. I could tell.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Yeah.
Do you remember what we talked about?
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
I scoured the city for it.
Happy Birthday.
Joel!
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Really? Is he cute?
What?
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
You remember what happened next?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you, Clem.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real. I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Joely...
More?
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
No, it isn't that.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Would you get me another, Joely?
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
I don't want to talk about this here.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I don't think we're ready.
Let's talk about it later.
Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
Where are you going?
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Let me drive you home.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino! Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
It's three.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Okay.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yeah? Oh, great!
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
No, not at all.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yeah.
Thanks.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I think about that.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Thanks.
No. I --
Well, I should probably get going.
You just say. I'm not really --
What do you want to hear?
Ready for another?
I'm fine.
Cheers.
It's pretty.
Frost?
I don't know.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Very much.
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that. Anyway. See Ya.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
What?
Sort of, um...
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I like to read.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
You know Wilmont?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Yeah?
I don't want to take you out of your way.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... Take care, then.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Okay.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
I'm not nuts.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm Joel.
Yeah, I got it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski. The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Someone's got that job. Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me. How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Oh. So...
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Really?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Why?
Jesus.
I don't know. Panties and --
You must have been crazy.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Hi, it's Joel.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
It's true.
+++$+++ Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
+++$+++ I probably got the same thing as you.
+++$+++ Yeah?
I guess so.
Oddly enough, I do.
I just walked in.
There you are. Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
+++$+++ Long day thinking.
+++$+++ Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
+++$+++ Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
+++$+++ Hi.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Naomi.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
She's so sexy.
How's the chicken?
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
That's your look for me.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
It's too late.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
Fuck you, Clementine.
I might be making a mistake.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
It was snowing.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
You have to stop this!
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Well... I did.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We'll speak soon.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I'm glad you called.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I'm sorry.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I hope you get your work done.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
In a minute.
Go back to sleep.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi.
It's not somebody else.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
You take it. I don't know.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth. I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Then why did you ask me?
Nothing.
Can I... I brought some --
Hi.
Thanks, Stan.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hell no.
He's coming?
No way. I can handle this.
Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Well, what should we do?
I don't know. He's not on the map.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
What?
You love him, don't you?
Yeah.
Go.
Yup.
Yup.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
We haven't checked.
You found us okay?
I better do this, Stan.
'kay.
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Stan... c'mon...
Boo.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
You made me have an abortion.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what?
What, Howard?
We can't do this.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all. I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
You are such a sweetheart.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Welcome, Howard.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Yes?
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
+++$+++ 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
+++$+++ He went home sick.
+++$+++ I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
+++$+++ The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Jesus.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
That's fine, Stan.
Oh dear.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Yeah. Of course.
I tried that already.
Mary. What are you doing here?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
+++$+++ This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
+++$+++ Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
+++$+++ Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend. Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
What's your bartlett's?
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Jesus, Patrick!
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Patrick, we need to focus.
This one's history. Moving on...
You can if you want.
She likes you okay.
Just wanted to let you know.
Yeah.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Then check the connections.
That's your problem.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
Is everything getting worse?
What do you believe in then?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Clockworks.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Save your breath for the climb.
I know who you are.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
I don't.
I'm staying with the Countess.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
No, I guess not.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
That's Jellybean!
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
What is Debbie's position?
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
You're political, then?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Tell me about it.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
+++$+++ Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
+++$+++ Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
+++$+++ What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
+++$+++ Whose fault was that?
+++$+++ Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
+++$+++ What do you think?
How does she like what in bed?
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Extraordinary!
Why? Why do you have to go?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
What are you doing?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
I'm the best.
Yep.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
I was a successful model once.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
+++$+++ Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
+++$+++ Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
+++$+++ Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
+++$+++ Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
+++$+++ Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
+++$+++ I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
+++$+++ Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Your ranch?
+++$+++ What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
+++$+++ You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see, from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
+++$+++ Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
+++$+++ Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
+++$+++ That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
+++$+++ To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Justin?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
I heard it.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
On my way.
I'll get him.
Hold on, Coop...
Coop, where are you...
I'll be all over it.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
From what?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Roger that.
Solid as a rock. Hey, Smith...
It's holding... She's holding...!
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
No, he didn't.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
No, thank you.
What?
Run!
Hurry.
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Can you shut it down?
How? The Bridge is gone.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
What's happening?
Is that an offer?
Please... kill...
Please...
What happened?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing. But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen... And what it's brought back with it.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Do you hear it? Right there.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Go on.
What is it?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
How is he?
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
Trauma.
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
90 over 50 and falling... .
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
What's wrong?
Thank you.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What's on your mind?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
Starck!
From the Other Place...
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
What does?
What, Justin, what shows you?
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
How do you know all this?
Justin. I won't let you die.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Patch me through to him.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
This is Weir.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Justin.
Do it.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
...you okay?
Skipper...
Crystallized.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Alive?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
What you got, Peters?
There's no one here, Skipper.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
What's the hold up?
You can't have them. Go to hell.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
What are you?
Then who the fuck are you?
What makes you think I'll miss?
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is? It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil. It's a liberating experience.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
Son of a bitch!
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Watch me.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed. Fuck this ship.
It's done.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is. Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
We're leaving.
I DON'T KNOW! I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
I don't know...
I don't know...
Yes...
What do you want me to say?
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Do it.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Explanation?
It's 2041...
What about it?
You have something, Dr. Weir?
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
If it worked, yes.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
What could cause them? What's in the Core?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
Yes.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
No one?
Any survivors?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
I can see that, what're they for?
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
That is not acceptable --
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
What does it say?
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Get out of there now!
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Come again, Skipper?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Skipper...
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Captain, we got a problem.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
That's enough!
Understood.
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Captain Miller, you copy?
But...
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
We don't have time to fart.
We have a situation here...
Captain Miller...
It is now. We're locked in.
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
We've got some weather.
Yes, sir.
Something like that, yeah.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
One-four degrees...
Heading three-three-four...
Jesus...
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Weir.
...repeat, we're armed...
No. I'll be right back.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Weir can't be alive.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
I'm on my way, Starck.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Justin's in the airlock.
Miller, come in...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
I know that.
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
You've got to listen...
Go ahead.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
What is it, Starck?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
No. It was someone else.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
What's causing the readings?
What about the life readings you picked up?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Carbon dioxide?
How much oh-two do we have?
But you can breathe it.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
Everybody okay?
That's an affirmative.
Radiation interference?
Come around to three-three-four...
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
I did.
There's no one here.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
They're explosive charges.
DJ! It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
He served on the Goliath.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
First time in a grav couch?
It's cold.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Do you know what it was?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
He's engaged the override.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
We're losing atmosphere...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
She's not ugly.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here... ...to "point B," here. Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
I'm trying, goddammit --
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Explosive decompression.
Picking up magnetic interference.
1000 meters...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
It means nothing.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
What is it?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What are you doing?
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Yes.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
I can't believe we built this.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Ship's log.
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
A straight line.
How?
I like the sound of that.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
I'm not really dressed for a party.
How'd you know it was me?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
+++$+++ I mean...
+++$+++ You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Victor must've taken him.
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Oh, he did.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
You look like an eighties rock band.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
What do you want, Vic?
What is this? Where's Reed?
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
I'm worried about you.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben?
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
I'll be watching over you.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...? Ben...
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben --
It's about to be a broken face.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah. You don't wanna know the details.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
What the --!
Are you alright?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I should have done more, run more tests --
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Should?
Victor's better at these things.
He's made a few changes.
This makes five.
Five times.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Youthful high spirits.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
What about his first born?
I can't take this.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
No more cracks about how I look.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Hey! That's a prototype!
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
What?
What do you mean "complete"?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
And they're changing into...
+++$+++ No: You're ON FIRE!
+++$+++ You're on fire!
I though we went over this.
Me like-y.
+++$+++ My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
+++$+++ I mean, you feel a little feverish.
+++$+++ You're hot!
+++$+++ And where do we think we're going?
But all these people...
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
You need to control yourself and think before you --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Back it down, Johnny!
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Oh, it is.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
You've been working out.
Ben, are you there?
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Now what is up with that?
He's not responsive --
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
You two need a time-out.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles. What?!
I'm driving.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Sweet.
You're really cramping my style here.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
I think that thing is Ben.
Okay, "mom."
Johnny.
Please tell me you go silent too.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
And that's a good thing?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal... I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
How's the IPO?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Then what is it?
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
They're ready for you, sir.
And if he's not...?
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
You need a doctor.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You were?
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Of course. Of course.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
What are you doing?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
That's what we're here to find out.
What...? Oh.
We need to get past them.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
Sue... look at your hands.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
For science.
Which was?
You're happy for me and Victor.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Feeling better?
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
But I'm not done with the machine --
What are you doing here?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Ben did this.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Reed, we're running out of time.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Sure.
Hilarious.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Not at all.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Please don't make this personal --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
You said it was urgent.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, your scar --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
What's going on?
Raising the shields.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts... Four little words that can change our lives...
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's just business.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
All right!!
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Don't worry about it.
Of course.
Later.
There it is!
On the ledge?
I can't find it, mon!
Totally.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
No.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Does Mom know you have company?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
But your face did!
You are a virgin!
I don't know. I was just curious.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I'm just guessing.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Is everything okay at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
They're not home yet.
Don't strain yourself.
Your friends use the pool too.
Why can't you do it?
Hey-yo.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is? What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over. So who do you have first period?
Hi, Brad.
Yes, sir.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Okay, Dennis.
But they weren't mine.
They were left over from the last shift.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Dad says!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Ugh.
Get going.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
We've got to get an abortion?
All right, I take it back.
I know it's yours.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
What? Now?
What's going on?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
I didn't see you this morning.
I guess I did.
What's wrong?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Hey, Mike?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
You first.
No. Are you crazy?
You're a really good kisser.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
Are you really a virgin?
Pick a suit.
Well...
I know what I look like.
I don't know.
Sure. Come on in.
Mark is a really nice boy...
What a guy.
Get a ride with somebody.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Oh, really?
Nice to meet you.
+++$+++ It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
+++$+++ Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
+++$+++ Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
+++$+++ Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
+++$+++ And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
+++$+++ The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
+++$+++ You're losing it, Damone.
+++$+++ I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
+++$+++ Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
+++$+++ No Damone. I don't understand.
+++$+++ Chicken!
+++$+++ Really.
+++$+++ Okay. See ya.
+++$+++ Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
+++$+++ Damone! You come here?
I'm really pretty busy...
+++$+++ No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
+++$+++ It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
+++$+++ Damone. It's Mark.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
+++$+++ Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
+++$+++ Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
+++$+++ Yeah?
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
+++$+++ You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
+++$+++ Really?
+++$+++ Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
+++$+++ No. It's too soon.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ She's in my biology class.
+++$+++ Damone, you gotta listen to me.
+++$+++ What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
You should work for yourself.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Not if you're over sixteen.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Yes.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Totally.
That's me, Merv.
Fascinating.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
I don't go at all.
School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How've you been?
That's him! He did it!
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Just be glad you're all right.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
They're fuckin' with us.
This ain't no cop.
I like sex.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Seen the new Playboy?
He is.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yeah, like maybe never.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes.
He's not coming.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
What do you want?
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick!
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
That little prick.
That little prick.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
What?
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
What do you think?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
How long does Doug take?
No. But it's a nice idea.
Climax together.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Thanks a lot.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
It was nice.
It was okay.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
There's nothing to it.
What's the big deal?
What variables?
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
I know.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Really?
I can't do that.
So what did you do?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
What should I do?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Do you think that guy's cute?
+++$+++ Aloha, Spicoli.
All right! Oh, yeah!
You're gonna flunk me?!
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
+++$+++ Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
+++$+++ Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
I don't know. I guess so.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
+++$+++ That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
+++$+++ And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I don't know.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I couldn't make it in time.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
+++$+++ Yes.
That's the name they gave me.
+++$+++ Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
+++$+++ Really?
+++$+++ What class?
Yes.
No. I mean back to your home.
I think I better take you home.
Are you really nineteen?
It's very warm out tonight.
That's a nice shirt.
The point sounds fine.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. So do you.
No problem.
How about your phone number?
I know, everyone says that.
I'd like that.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Hi, Mark.
What about the notes?
I made a fool of myself.
+++$+++ John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
+++$+++ It's John Bonham's birthday.
+++$+++ Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
+++$+++ Well... it's getting kind of late.
+++$+++ ...I've got to go home.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
+++$+++ Naw. I don't mind.
+++$+++ No. That's okay.
+++$+++ Where's your brother?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Do you want to come inside?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
+++$+++ Two more Cokes.
Not at all.
+++$+++ Oh yeah.
+++$+++ Excellent.
+++$+++ Do you know what you want?
+++$+++ Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
+++$+++ Yeah. She is pretty good.
+++$+++ Yeah. It's my sister's.
+++$+++ Sure thing.
+++$+++ Oh... yes.
+++$+++ My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
We keep them.
+++$+++ I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Okay. Thanks.
Anything to drink?
Are you ready to order here?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Killed?
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Well, thank you.
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Let's have lunch!
There's no hurry! The race is over!
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Sir? This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Dobermans don't talk.
WHAT?
Naked.
Not where we operate.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
He wanted the pineal gland.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Not down in my parts.
Naw!
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
This is my granddaughter...
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
What?
Hell, no!
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
The airport is over there!
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Do you think you can handle it?
So do we, lady.
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Yes!
Right!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Some of what?
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
Where'd you get this?
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Adrenochrome...
What is this?
It's gone too far.
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
No, she's looking for you.
Good work. They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Like big lizards.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Read the newspapers.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Us?
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
NO! Stop talking like that.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Plans?
It can't be helped. This is Lucy. You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
The cops?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
Jesus.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Whatever's right.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
When does this thing stop?
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
GO?
Not much. Why?
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Why what?
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
That's good...
What are you talking about?
Shoot it.
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to... He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
You whore!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Where's the medicine?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Damn right!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Don't take any guff from these swine. Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Jesus! Did I say that?
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
I fear nothing.
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
You'd pay me for that?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
+++$+++ Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
+++$+++ Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
+++$+++ You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
Of course, officer.
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
What?
In that case, maybe she can help.
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case... ...on the eye.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Where is everyone?
We're going to get my little girl.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We should go! We should go right now!
I will not die because of him!
Careful.
We can't risk letting them in.
+++$+++ With what just happened upstairs --
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
+++$+++ But it's got teeth.
Her fella.
Nah, I got the gun.
Yeah.
+++$+++ We're lucky to be alive.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
+++$+++ Anyone.
+++$+++ I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
+++$+++ One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
OPEN THE DOOR!
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Come on, come on.
Upstairs.
I think I know where a CB is.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You seem mighty collected about this.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
We just smeared a skunk.
Where's the tunnel?
You all sure about this?
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it. Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
There's a tunnel.
Easy.
Hey!
Well, justice is funny.
So, your husband ditched you?
And that's how I ended up here.
And the rest of 'em?
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
What?
The door... on three.
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
Scared?
Fuck you too.
+++$+++ My truck.
He's dead.
Who's with me?
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
+++$+++ You weren't helpin'.
+++$+++ Fuck no.
+++$+++ So, what now? Did those things leave?
+++$+++ Your parents of relation?
+++$+++ Your brother, huh?
+++$+++ Why do you take shit from him?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
+++$+++ Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
What's in the back?
+++$+++ Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
What?
Anybody else?
We're going to get help.
+++$+++ I'm in.
What? Really?
How much you got to see the show?
How much you got?
You wanna see, baby?
Um-hmmm.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
+++$+++ It's much safer in there, sweety.
+++$+++ Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
+++$+++ No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
+++$+++ Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
+++$+++ It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
+++$+++ Magic potion. You should try a little.
+++$+++ Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
+++$+++ Push and twist, it's child proof.
How are you holding up?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Keys.
Nine?
Max?
How many?
Open?
Four door?
Is it gassed up?
What's it for!?
What's going on between you two?
What do you mean what?
What?
+++$+++ Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
+++$+++ In the kitchen, under the sink.
+++$+++ The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
He shot you the other time.
He only shot you once.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Oh? And what's that?
Whoa!
Get outta here.
Clear!
What the hell's going on here!?
No bullshit.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
You smell like ass!
F-f-fuck you.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Get something on that.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
If he doesn't shut up...
I'm fine! I'm fine!
You keep that key handy.
No shit.
What?!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Fine, Chief.
'Eh, Chief?
Got 'cha!
OH JESUS!
Am I too heavy for you?
Amazing you made it this far.
BONSAI!
I'm sure.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Let's move.
Yeah, I'll go.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Hey!
Well, maybe they migrate?
+++$+++ Let's wait it out.
+++$+++ DON'T!
Let's go.
+++$+++ What's wrong?
+++$+++ Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Get to your cars!
Not without you!!!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Wait God-dammit!
Whoa!
That's fine.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Did we make it?
We should stick together out there.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Her name is Charlie.
We all have to be strong, right?
I'm fine, I really am.
All right.
Let's lock off this room.
Stop her!
That's one piece of four problems.
+++$+++ I just hit it like you said.
+++$+++ I said I'm not lying.
+++$+++ I'm not lying.
+++$+++ Well...
+++$+++ Um, well...
+++$+++ Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
What're you doing?
Frances? Oh no.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
I think it's time to take the gloves off. Get me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons!
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Very fine bone structure.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Who's this?
I'd like nothing better.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
My clothes?
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Okay, but come here first.
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Madam...?
Good, good. Give them that.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
You're afraid!
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
What does Clifford say?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
A rich actress.
Who?
You don't think I'm good enough?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What's up?
He's not here.
Frances.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Who is she?
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
You're under arrest.
Get your clothes on, lady --
Get your clothes on.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
In my eyes, officer.
You want his name?
What night?
No?
Dick...
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dick, we need some time apart --
Showdown.
...Yes.
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
There've been some calls.
You learn your lines?
All square, Doc.
I gotta go now.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Thank you, Harry.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
I know you believe that.
Thank you.
Really?
But I'll never win that.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
No. Never.
No.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Daddy!
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
I love you too, Francie.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I know that, Dad, but --
...So what do you think?
I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Of course.
What do I do, Dad?
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
I know.
He's a socialist, then?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I didn't have much to do with it.
Thanks, Dad.
See you next weekend, Dad.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
See you next weekend?
I'm going back to the hotel.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
Bread?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Oh, Kurt!
But, Kurt, I...
Kurt!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Fifteen.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
+++$+++ You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Why, you... you little bastard!
What is this?
What?
They'll mend.
...Not if I can help it.
No, I don't hate it.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Are you an actor?
I wouldn't miss it.
You can always come see it in London.
Just a little way.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
No, we're not.
Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Why do you say that?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Well... you're looking well.
How did I look?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
I hope so, Frances.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
I don't know.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Where to?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Frances! Frances!
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances, You're crazy.
You give up on her?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
What's that?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Huh?
No. To thoroughbreds.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
You can't drink.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You know something, Harry?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Huh?
Whattaya think you're in now?
...Take advantage of me.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I should've known...
Where are we, mean man?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Evening, gorgeous.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Take a walk, pal.
And?
You're coming.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
I took the early rounds.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
What for?
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Think I'll have a glass.
Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Calm down, Frances.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I know.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Forget it.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Well, the studio told me not to.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Serious, huh?
Harry... I met someone.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage?
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Eight stories.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Kaminski.
Came to get a tan.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Frances...
You don't know what you want.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
What happened to him?
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
What?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
How'd I look?
Well? What'd you think?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Harry.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Yeah, well --
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Okay then...
Don't touch me.
Run!
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Where you goin'?
And no people.
Pretty morning.
Fine!
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
...Is that not true?
What?
I live here.
What happened? Who're you?
You got it.
The speech? Real good.
I already have.
Your big speech?
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
'Golden Boy.'
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I'm going out!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Mama, shut up!
No!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Haven't you heard what I said?
Mama...?
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
I'm back, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Say you promise.
At one. Promise?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
How long will you be?
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Go on...
You kill me, Mama.
Then why did you bring them?
Why are these all opened?
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
You're taking me home!
Mama, what's...
Smile, little sister, smile.
...You will.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Mama...
WIFE +++$+++ No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
WIFE +++$+++ I don't believe so.
WIFE +++$+++ Yes...?
WIFE +++$+++ On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Symington says...
Frances, I'm warning you...
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Oh for Christ's...
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
What?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
This whole thing is a joke!
...Did you really say that?
Normal. Average.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Oh! Are you really?
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
CROWD +++$+++ No! No!
CROWD +++$+++ No!
CROWD +++$+++ No!
+++$+++ 'Incurable.'
+++$+++ Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
+++$+++ I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
+++$+++ I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
What kindness?
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
And he drove me to mine.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
Yes.
I am afraid.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Yes. Very close
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Worse.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Better that way... for me.
The music? Or the fire?
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
She's beautiful.
I will not! Kill me now!
No. I draw the line.
This was not taken from a grave.
What is this?
Why... her?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together. No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours. You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
There is something I want. A friend.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? Who am I?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Materials. Nothing more.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Evil? Do you believe in evil?
Your crime... as well as mine.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me? What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice. Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Kill you? Hardly that.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Are you all right?
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
I should go. I should leave today.
Something's wrong. I know it. I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Must've been a terrible row.
You dance so beautifully together.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Quite right!
There, there... shhh...
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Is he not back yet?
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Open this door for no-one!
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Now husband and wife.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
What sort of task?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Your decision. For us.
Not as weak as I.
I will be here when you return.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I wish to be your wife.
Brother and sister still?
This feels... incestuous.
I've loved you all my life
You will. What do you want, Victor?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Father's so proud.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
God took her from us.
What kind of God is He to will this?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
A warming wind.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
It wouldn't dare.
Oh God.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Let it go.
I owe you that. Done.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
What happened up there?
For what?
Quite a place.
No. They don't.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Mine and Professor Krempe's. We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just a sip. I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
That is my concern. I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
I've been preoccupied.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
That's blasphemy!
You can't. Death is God's will!
You're making a scene!
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
They'll hang him all the same.
They just caught the man who did it.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Only you would think of that!
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Now you've got him started.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Quite a few.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Do you really think I'm mad?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
As a march hare.
Very well then.
I have no knowledge of that.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
I have always loved him.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
The strain was evident.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous. I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Professor Waldman.
Who are you?
Madness?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You know of it?
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
There's a startling question, coming from you. I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Are you a physician?
I'm... dying.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
+++$+++ I will protect you.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
No, no, they're all dead...
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Good night, Alice.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I was careless.
Right! Right!
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
What'd you see?
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Next Friday.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Wet. I don't know.
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Marcie?
Okay.
They're off now.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
It sounded like Brenda.
I don't hear it anymore.
Help you clean up?
Good point.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Almost five.
I don't know.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything. I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
Artist.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Maybe I can help?
How come you're leaving?
Oh, my God...
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Alice? The others show up?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out. Thanks, Alice.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
No, they won't...
Claudette...
I wouldn't know.
You know what I said, though.
You said we were special.
You just had some lucky shots.
Chance to get even?
Roll him over!
What is it?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Thanks.
You saved my life.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Give me a hand?
What the hell?
That was the telephone.
Whatever you make yourself.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Dancer.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
It's gonna be a long summer.
Jack?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Ow!
Ha!
Whassamatta?
Umhummmmph.
Mmmmmmmph.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Lead the way!
I call it my shower dream.
You? The brick?
Looks like a storm.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Ned!
I don't love Neddy.
I love you.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here. Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Good call.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Those things can be nasty.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Rocky Road.
Okay, Fireman.
Cowboy.
It's beautiful...
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
That's thirty percent.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
One night on the town.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Aw.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
Anything else you want?
Another coincidence.
Sure.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Why not?
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Just my son and I.
Vamanos!
Yeah, follow us.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
You like the car?
Twenty-eight.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Why did they block the door again?
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
You don't believe in suicide.
He's running the show.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
What are you gonna do?
What's this guy's problem?
I'm exhausted.
The truth hurts.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
Kate, Scott?
Amen.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
What's this stuff?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
Did he...?
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
In other words, no.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
You too, preacher?
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
Now, is your shit together?
To your family.
What did you call me?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty?
Why not, against your religion?
Who else?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Then?
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
I don't have the slightest idea.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you. Kate, honey!
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Why'd ya quit?
Was? As in not anymore?
You're a preacher?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Is this real?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Died instantly?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
How'd she die?
She's dead?
Where is the little lady?
Who's this?
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is. What are their names?
Yes.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Not a chance.
On the dresser.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid. You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Jacob.
Everybody goes home!
I'm going for 'em!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Scott?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
It's a flop house.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
Ain't it the truth.
It's the bitterest of pills.
What did I say?
Do what?
What?
What's in Mexico?
Where are you taking us?
Sure.
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Later.
Me too.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
How many bullets left, kid?
Watch my back!
Daddy's dead.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Okay.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
You damn well better. Go.
Do you believe me?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Creepy guy.
-- see this, television!
-- you got your sink --
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
+++$+++ Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
+++$+++ What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
+++$+++ Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
+++$+++ Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Six-fifty.
Knock yourself out.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Not even for lunch?
Hot goddamn day!
I never said help us!
I wasn't scratching!
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
+++$+++ This bar is for bikers and truckers only. You, get out!
+++$+++ This is a private club. You're not welcome.
+++$+++ You can't come in here.
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Yeah.
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
My shit is together.
I'm here with you.
What do you mean?
How?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
That's what you look like.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
They broke when you fell.
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
We are... "South of the border down Mexico way."
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
I don't know, you just passed out.
You okay?
This ain't the time.
Or what?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
What does that mean?
They're gonna search the van.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
This isn't gonna work.
Richard!
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
No. That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
She's in the other room.
What?
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Cops.
Sight seein'.
-- This conversation is over.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter". You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
I'm gonna go get the money.
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
How's it feel?
Do they have a waterbed?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Do they have cable?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
One... Two... Three.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Shut up and start the car.
Start the car.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
What the fuck was that about?
He needs our help!
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man. He's a preacher.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
How 'bout you? You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine. Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
Wow...
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane." See what you can find.
Or rank. But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Don't say my name.
More than you'd guess. It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Just a friend. We have friends, too, you know.
I've been accused of that wish.
Just some of the women.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this? I mean, we're kinda curious.
They take you away to San Clemente Island. Half the guys quit when they come back. Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Thank you, ensign.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch. My office will follow up with details. Jumping off, now...
"Security"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?
Jordan, dear. How are they treating you?
Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway?
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m. From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President. This my shade? "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it. Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
I'm not sure what --
I don't see how, O'Neil. Dismissed.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant. But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders. There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty. You should prepare yourself.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
"We'll all have lunch." Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil. Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
Then good night.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator? And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Straight up?
Well. 'Least now we're talking the same language. So one standard. Is that what you're after?
No, sir, WHAT?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment. What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears. But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities. DOES IT?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander? If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Oh, really.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. A name?
Pardon the hour, sir. But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement. I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
None at this time, sir.
Really, I have no problem with --
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
So. We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training. It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Would you care for a beverage? Tea?
Yes, of course. Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Entering my scan now...
No problem, sir!
Motherachrist...
Sir...
O'Neil. Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there. You know that, don't you?
Fuck me.
Hey. Ain't your call, man.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Shit. Think we're had.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got a call this morning from --
Yes?
Think I overplayed it?
+++$+++ White House boys want a private meeting.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case in point...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off. No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. Don't play politics with me, little darlin'. You'd be up way past your bedtime.
You'll think about my offer?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that. Come work for me. I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
The reality is this: We send far too many men off to war. I don't need to compound the problem with women. Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
Jordan. I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire. Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
What changed?
Absolutely not.
Jordan. Might we do this over lunch tomorrow? I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Sounds familiar.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered. But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Hmmm. Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter. And your success would mean a lot. Jumping, now...
Yes, dear.
My office will fill him in and help expedite. Look forward to meeting you at the proper time. Jumping off now...
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat. Or, actually, its official non-policy. Now who's your immediate superior there?
California.
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia. Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
#1 +++$+++ I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
#1 +++$+++ Doesn't matter who she picks. No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course. And I don't care who it is.
#1 +++$+++ I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
Spotted you, Chief. Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows. Over.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water. Go, GO!
Fuck. Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
'Snot me. It's him.
Do that.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me. But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway. It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Sir?
+++$+++ Flea! O'Neil! Why is there a break in that line?
+++$+++ If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
+++$+++ ... two... one... MARK!
+++$+++ Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out. Five... four... three...
+++$+++ I oughtta report you.
+++$+++ She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
+++$+++ She's a trainee, just like the others. Why are you coming down so hard?
+++$+++ You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
+++$+++ Get it up!
+++$+++ Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
+++$+++ Check your watch, Pyro. Seems fast.
+++$+++ Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts. But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
+++$+++ The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday. By 18-hundred he was gone. Out of the Navy.
+++$+++ I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia. He wanted you to have it. He was very clear on that point.
What "all females"? If I'm the only --
+++$+++ You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil. Go regulation.
+++$+++ Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Look. It's not like you'd be completely out of reach. And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado. There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Yeah. Me too.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country. He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
"In Washington..."
I don't know, I don't care.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
What about him.
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
C'mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me.
No shortage of suspects.
Maybe. Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it. Almost like... Did I say he was class officer?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
Jordan. You watch your ass.
That's not what I want, Jordan. I mean... it is and it isn't...
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan. I think someone's gunning for you.
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane." You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
Don't you know? How they're talking about you?
Well, not this. I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago. Got some fresh stuff -- about you. You may be in a hostile camp. I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
That bad?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much less keep up with my phone life.
Thank you, Royce. It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Which is guy-speak for...
Wai', wait. What happens if it works? Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sorry. But after our days... So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you.
This has nothing to do with you.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits. I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Royce. We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
I take it you don't either. Feet.
Just like you would be.
Is this my glory, sir?
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back? Is that correct, O'Neil?
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Halfway 'round the world. So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil. Analyze.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
I'm sorry, O'Neil. But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta. Just, you know, nothing special.
Do you, uh, know...
I think you look beautiful.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four. Don't wanna come, do you?
That's okay. Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Let's keep talkin', Wick. Just keep talkin' to me...
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Not me. You?
At first.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there? Brother said it was worth it. Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep. But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette. Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline. This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense. So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone. But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother. He was Spec-Recon. And the stories he used to tell...
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They found his tracks. Well, shit.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Thanks, Wick.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
It was made clear. Anyway, stay ballsy. First week's hell, then it levels out. Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway. That's hell-and-a-half.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all. To your face, anyway.
They're more afraid of you.
Maybe half. Not even.
Smoke it!
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Mighta been civilian.
I don't know...
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist? How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
What're you guys doing? Huh?
+++$+++ O'Neil...
+++$+++ Got it.
+++$+++ Say again? How many micks?
+++$+++ Managed to activate the ELB. If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that. Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef. Over.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
+++$+++ I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
+++$+++ Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured? Didn't you even think about that?
No.
+++$+++ You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
+++$+++ I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage. You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
+++$+++ That's what your crew said. Are they lying? Or are you?
+++$+++ The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them. Because you went soft on another women --
+++$+++ Would you have shot if it was a man?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
+++$+++ Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why. This is my island. My world. And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside. If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you? Huh?
+++$+++ You are in the cage, O'Neil. Right here, right now.
+++$+++ Are you hungry? What's your favorite food? We'll try to get it for you.
+++$+++ Any brothers? Sisters?
+++$+++ Simple question, lieutenant. No reason not to answer. What is your father's name?
McCool's that same rank. We're both j.g.'s.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir. So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
+++$+++ Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
+++$+++ For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
+++$+++ It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs. Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives. They don't use women anymore.
+++$+++ Educate her, Pyro.
+++$+++ You heard me. Move on.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for?
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear. Try a wrench on that thing.
MOVE!
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site. Ready?
Clear.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Hey, hey, HEY. No possibility. You can't stay in here. You can't sleep right next to me.
Your new roommate.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
This ain't workin' right!
You mind? I'm trying to eat here.
Can't live with them, can't kill them. What's the point?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
+++$+++ This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook. but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it. A man-in-place. Makes everything very controllable.
+++$+++ Okay, so now work it from the other end. Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
+++$+++ I take it this file is still open.
+++$+++ This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school. The implications go way beyond.
+++$+++ If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
+++$+++ Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story. "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
+++$+++ The White House. If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades. Why? Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven.
The Navy? They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads. What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
The E-Ringers? Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
+++$+++ Sorry. Thought you knew I knew.
+++$+++ Thought you two were file-closed.
+++$+++ Subject?
Me!? You where the one...
What?
Where's Audrey?
Who the hell are all these people?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Big bites.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
Oh yes he will.
Only one way to find out.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
You made a mistake.
You okay?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
That why you dumped him?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
Circuits are overloaded.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
...he's pregnant.
I got pretty close.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change. I never lost my idealism.
Sure. I'd like that.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
So you made it.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
I'll take them all.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Your old sweetheart?
What the hell are you doing?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Who is he?
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Speak of the devil.
You're kidding, right?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Can I use some?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
You don't understand, I can get us information...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I can't.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
This is not the place...
I'll try.
Me too.
I don't think so.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?
Not for a long time, now.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Oh, I'm not married.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Where's Luc and Pierre?
That is when we will go in.
Allez, allez!
+++$+++ Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
+++$+++ Have them sealed off.
+++$+++ Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
+++$+++ Get your people out of there or I will.
+++$+++ Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
+++$+++ You're fast.
They are with me!
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
+++$+++ You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
+++$+++ Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
+++$+++ It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
+++$+++ We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
+++$+++ That's right.
+++$+++ You're standing on it.
+++$+++ Then you're perfect. Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
+++$+++ Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
+++$+++ No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
+++$+++ Yeah, you're the worm guy.
+++$+++ We know.
+++$+++ We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
+++$+++ Follow me.
+++$+++ Right. The worm guy. Can someone get those people off the beach?
+++$+++ Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
+++$+++ Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
+++$+++ We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
+++$+++ That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
+++$+++ General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park... We should be able to take him down.
+++$+++ We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Where are you?
Hello?
Who the hell are you?
What'd they say?
How do I do that?
Good idea.
You were right.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Makes us look more American.
Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Sure.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
We, have already taken care of them.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
I need you to trust me.
We know.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
It's the French Secret Service.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We've met before.
Thanks.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I have been blessed. Sir, I... I...
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
I'm... I'm shot.
Open.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Right... Sorry, sir.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Is that the bathroom?
Where's my bed?
This is it?
Just don't.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Well good, that's very... nice.
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
~hex! Alex, are you oKav?
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
That's your problem. You were never serious about the caraft... "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this? Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT. VIBRATIONS. Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
... . Well you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
I heard something. A squeal.
What? What?
You go first! There's no time!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
THIS much.
About this much.
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Like YOU know?
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...

I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
"The show must go on."
You WILL go out there.
Come on, old friend...
You have a better plan, Alex?
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
What's happened?
Could you possibly try not to hit every single one!
He wants to THINK!?
What the hell is going on?!!?
Settle down, Alex...
Not again...
He's a twit!
He always has to make the big entrance.
No I didn't.
What?
Down there.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Nobody was WATCHING?
Could they be the miners?
To see if there's a pub.
"Go into the cloud! ...
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
May I get the check?
We heard it the first time!
Oh my god, It's real.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
You could order something in.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
The guy is terminally selfish!
We'd better get everybody online. And Kyle, Stop downloading porn. Your frame rate is unacceptable.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Up.
GO Commander.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Wait two seconds then go.
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
BRANDON! TIME TO GO!
How did you come to that conclusion?
But you don't?
What do you mean?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Yes...?
We'd never have the budget for this.
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units. Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Okay, we got it.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Brandon.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
... Yes?
Yes but, we were wondering-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Systems register functional.
Systems register functional.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
I never get tired of that joke.
What's the weather like outside?
I just can't believe it. Any of it! Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven. Oh and wait, wait, listen to this! Computer?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
+++$+++ So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
+++$+++ What does that mean?!!! Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
+++$+++ That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Never mind, Fred....
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
It's suicide.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
...The digital conveyor.
You Okay, Alex?
How do you remember this stuff?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Oh, they're so cute.
Where are the miners?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
THAT'S why you built this ship?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre?
I know... You contruct a weapon. Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It's... I don't know.
Your last name.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
They're still behind us...
...Okay

We're alive!
Not a clue. You?
Where'd they go? Back inside?

Mark 12.
Well forget it! I'm not going. This episode was badly written!
We shouldn't have to DO this! It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
There's no hatch. There's no hatch!
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Jason?... I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
What? What did he say?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
It helps.
Why does this sound so familiar?
Don't be ridiculous.
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Self control? That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Can it be repaired?
Are they behind us?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING. Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Well you have to tell them. What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Only answers to me.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
It's Jason...

I heard it too.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough. Face it, he's dead.
I can't... It's on autopilot!...
Sure, no problem.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
You should have let me hit him.
That's it, It's go time.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Unbelievable.
You're kidding. When for?
Where the hell is he? An hour and a half late. An hour and a half!
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
We.. We lie.
We pretend...
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Explain -
Wait. What did you say?
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Stop, please! I don't know!
I don't know.
Yes.
You have ten seconds.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
You can oc that?
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations. It's all a fake. I'm not him... I'm a nothing. A nobody.
A model, only as big as this.
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Well... Sort of...
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Mathesar? What is that?
Commander...
Former Commander?
Then how did he find out about the device?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
To our brave guests. Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes. We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Thanks
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00. But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Long live Theramini. Take a left here?
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Home.
As you wish.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II. Would you like to don your uniform?
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula. Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death... Please Captain, you are our last hope. We have secured a limousine.
I... certainly, but-
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Hold course, Laredo!
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Pedal to the metal...
Practice driving, Tommy.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on. Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
NO NO NO.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
How about the pig-lizard?
Good work, Tommy. Let's go!
Okay, let's go.
Tommy, we have these...
Anything.
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Do your best, Tommy...
Could be this.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Where?
Well, it's... This was a device we... discovered on an alien planet. We don't know what it does either.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
Wh... Where are we?
And determination.
I didn't say that. I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.

But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
What does she see in them?
I wish she was beneath me.
Well, now there's something worth dying for. What do you think?
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits! It's becoming the American way!
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'. The man's a budding Cromwell. He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Gates? He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack. George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain. I think you need to entertain more. Seriously! Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
That can't be.
Same old story.
Exactly. We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard. It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
Well, George, who were you?
We're so damned important! Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you. Your own aide!
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is. It may come down to us, or them someday. You or them. Cicero was right: was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
The army can survive without me.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
It is.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
But trust you to do what? One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money. But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring! Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion. Even John Adams voted against it...
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
It comes down to leaders. If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die? The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
And a French alliance?
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Exceedingly. Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Over three hundred miles.
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
We've got to attack the British! Now! Have they put you in charge yet? Do we have an army yet? What is happening?
Well, what have you thought?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
+++$+++ No. I guess.
+++$+++ Yes, general.
+++$+++ Yes, general?
Yes, William. I am apologizing.
+++$+++ That you would have known you can trust me.
+++$+++ A lot of years have gone by.
+++$+++ Well... I misunderstood, then.
+++$+++ Yes, General. But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
+++$+++ You, you just need a new flint, General.
+++$+++ Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Negroes? Washington has black men in his army? Are they good fighters? What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing? I should say, no sort of boots at all. Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet? Is that what he marched here in?
No uniforms. No coats, even? In this weather?
+++$+++ That's Greene. He's supporting our reconsolidation.
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals! They are not cowards, sir! They are not afraid!
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
+++$+++ I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
General Lee, welcome back. I'm happy you've decided to join us.
That's why the people trust you George. Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
Yes, I believe so.
March on Philadelphia! Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war! Get them all! Sweep them aside!
Is this a coup? Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
To hell with Arnold...
No one knows...
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
I am not conscious of it, sir! But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
Sir, I think no such thing.
Yessir.
General Greene is here. There are two other divisions here.
What are we going to do?
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix. But, then I went to King's College.
They're among the best divisions the British have. No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness. It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
I'm so inclined.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I. But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Delighted, sir.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Then use rocks!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
+++$+++ George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
+++$+++ Who's in command out there?
+++$+++ Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand. What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here? Who are those people in there? The fat ones in silk?
Lafayette is my friend! He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child. But he would have died before he would have let me down.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them? Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
+++$+++ Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all. Quite the character. He's got a tremendous reputation.
+++$+++ You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
+++$+++ With your support, Horatio. As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
+++$+++ Partially...
+++$+++ Finally!? It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more. More ale, here!
+++$+++ He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
+++$+++ You invented this, this...
+++$+++ Gag on your own invention, then.
+++$+++ I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored! "General Washington! Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!" And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
+++$+++ Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler! He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition. Now, you listen to me: we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight! What have we been struggling for all these years? For this moment! And, if we fail now, remember: you stopped us!
+++$+++ Washington is perfect. He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
+++$+++ Unofficially, General Greene.
+++$+++ Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
+++$+++ The British army, sir!
+++$+++ General Lee is detained captain...
+++$+++ No officer is going to get these men to fight! They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
+++$+++ Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
+++$+++ I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
+++$+++ Well, I shall deny him to you! He is evil on earth!
How can you say that?
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
+++$+++ Understand? You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
+++$+++ And, Hamilton? Greene?
+++$+++ George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
+++$+++ But the Hessians are there! No one can beat them! That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor! They are invincible!
I mean, I'm a Deist. A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin. Surely you knew that.
+++$+++ To assert the rights of our founding fathers! This country was colonized by Christians! This shall become a Christian revolution. Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
+++$+++ A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
+++$+++ Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
+++$+++ That damned Arnold is here, isn't he? Did you know he lost all his ships? Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
Colonel Reed...
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here: our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there.
+++$+++ Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
Get these men back in line!
My God! Who ordered this retreat?!
What is it, Marquis?
Like flowers after the snow melts.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed. And the revolution would be finished. Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
I rode here, on my horse.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
I only meant...
I am. Then, I understand you too serve without salary. You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening. I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take. I am serving without salary.
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
'Continentals', Congress' paper money. It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless. Can you tell which one is fake?
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress... Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and... You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left. Her name is Henriette...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
I don't want to see your hospital.
Not today.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws. One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Don't condescend to me! We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Some things must never change.
Oh, indeed? You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes! They beg you to consider the future. What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army. There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal. They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
That's right...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven. Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart. I was drunk on something then...
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans? As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them. Martha, you must trust me.
And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain?
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say? If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you! They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you! Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
My God, what?
But to go to war over trade, over money? Surely there's still time for a compromise.
War? No! I did not! When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable. There's no middle ground at all? We're the King's children!
My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire. I don't need to be in government.
+++$+++ It is; we need you George.
+++$+++ Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
+++$+++ Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis. Marquis, you must go with him.
+++$+++ What the hell are we doing?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
General Greene?
I certainly didn't mean you. Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
A horseshoer?
But, you do come from a military family?
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
+++$+++ Yessir!
+++$+++ We're leaving them?
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Now that is a lie! See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet! When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William! Do you hear? You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Is it? William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial? I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
And what is this, then? Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot? Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
George, you know I only love you, but...
You know very well who it is that I love.
Words, words, words! Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Hear that, George? Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home. And it's her first tour. We're gratified, aren't we George?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth. The temperature is generally mild.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you! In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor? Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family. I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
+++$+++ That's good... who?
And dost thou live to ask it?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre. I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
+++$+++ They can use their imaginations.
+++$+++ You're out of your mind!
+++$+++ What are you doing?
I don't laugh at you, George. I like you. I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Do you? When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
It's stupid, of course.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see? Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Capture them? Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Africa? That's so far? How do they get here?
Where... do those men come from, George?
+++$+++ Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
That? I hear a mob: unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions? Because each of us is who we are: we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change. The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us. And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
I see...
Who says so?
Just because they are born?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
He was not black! He was... tan! Weathered!
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face. You look like a damned slave! It's damned humiliating.
My daughter, I ask only...
The land here is best for grain and corn.
You're kidding me, right?
I reserved a Cadillac.
What is this?
+++$+++ You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
+++$+++ Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
+++$+++ Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
You get life for kidnapping.
Trade for what?
No. What's this?
+++$+++ Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
+++$+++ I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
+++$+++ Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Farrah. Come here.
Come here, Farrah...
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
+++$+++ Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
+++$+++ I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
I mean I don't care.
I guess still in the locker.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
+++$+++ Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
+++$+++ And I mean high up in it. That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
So... how many movies you been in?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I have to ask you for that key.
You spotted them, huh?
So you didn't have the key with you.
I went to UC San Diego. We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars. Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
You gave him the money?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
+++$+++ Your who?
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
What?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
+++$+++ In the can. That the money?
Gimme an hour.
I'll find it.
+++$+++ Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
+++$+++ That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Karen? You okay?
I don't believe this.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
+++$+++ Tell you what...
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
What money?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
+++$+++ That's all.
+++$+++ There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
She's... young.
Get something going there.
There's Ilona.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
That's right, me.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
+++$+++ What's this movie you're doing first?
C-18.
I don't know.
The airport.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
+++$+++ He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer. So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
+++$+++ All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
+++$+++ Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
I'm working on a few things.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
+++$+++ You positive about that?
+++$+++ Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
You say look at you?
What?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Or else what?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Never heard of him.
Who?
Okay. So who are you?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Ray Barboni?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go. Why haven't you left?
Yeah? Which terminal?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
I don't like waiting.
He owes me money.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
Who the fuck are you?
That's what I'd do. Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Not yet. I just started.
I'm a producer.
I'm in the movie business.
That's right.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
What've you got?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Who?
You have it?
I found him.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Really.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Here's your keys, Harry.
Hey, Harry.
His shrink's trainer.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
You're kidding, right?
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action... What's he doing? Following a guy?
What do you get out of this?
You don't even know these guys.
Just a thought.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
He drown?
So what's the problem?
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
One of his best parts.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
What's it called?
For a movie?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Once.
Maybe a few times I have.
Not really.
They always paid.
What I did till recently. After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
So you don't work for the casino?
But you work for the casino?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
That's it? That's your movie?
So he comes to L.A...
Keep going.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
You just did.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Fuckin' basketball game.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
A marker's like a check, Harry.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
That's what I'm doing.
I'm looking at you.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Have we met? I don't recall.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Twenty seven hundred.
Ask your man here.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
It was in the Herald.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Yeah, he told me.
He died.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
Wow. Mind if I take it for a spin?
What's that?
Very nice...
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Good-looking, too. Like Karen.
How do I know that?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
How about this?
Wait. How about this?
Like this?
I'm looking at you.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
With what? Wiseguy money?
One of mine?
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
Yeah. That was a good party.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
It's all mine.
How? By taking my money?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
How'd you know I was here?
Who told you that?
I'm up twelve grand today.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer. Works for Jimmy Capp.
We call you a taxi.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Go get your stuff.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
You bet.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
I'll go. I'll go.
I don't know.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You sure?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Why not?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Harry... My God...
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right. Although I've added to it.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I want to know.
What do you get out of it?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Then you've read it?
I think it's not horrible.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I just caught the end.
Yeah. Right. Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
"Cotton".
Man, can you scream.
For any movie.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Rough day on the set?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
That's right. Three percent.
I know what a vig is.
What if it was?
You broke in?
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Whatta you doing out there?
He already knew it.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
I told you not to -–
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.' 'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Hm?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now... She's gonna talk to Martin?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Murray's dead.
You seem to feel fine about it.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you. I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
I miss Murray, Harry.
What a spectacular view.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Hello, Doris.
Harry -–
'We?'
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Oh, yeah, sure.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
That's where you got the idea?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
How did you get in the house?
Harry -–
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
I don't have a dog.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through. Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Be quiet and listen.
Shylock?
What money?
Mob guy?
Which two?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
But you are interested?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Oh, for Christ's sake –-
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories. Of us.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...

You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
The turbine blew.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
I don't know. Tuesday?
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
Let's not be too hasty.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
What's so great about Sweden?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up. An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Damn mind of it's own.
Fucker!
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
That's what it says.
Sixty pounds.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Get up.
Dodge. Dodge.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Did you?
Try Wednesday.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. What happened up there?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Smokes?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
So we kill him?
Gimme a break.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
I like my job.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What other choices have we got?
This's gonna hurt a little.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Ready?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
You think that's funny
Roger?
Maureen?
What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
What is your first name?
One more?
Where from?
Don't fall asleep.
You're late.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
What the hell happened!
Yeah.
Conveniently enough for you.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
What the fuck -- ?
What?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
The radio!
I think you know.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
What do you propose?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
How do you mean?
If they knew what they were carrying.
Not me.
I think you better see this for yourself.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Dodge to Murphy.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Can't you use something else?
That'd be my guess.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Bodies're too fresh.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Not in the eyes of the law.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Sounds like the hull.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Or somebody stopped them.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
She take a radio?
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Three, four days.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Hard to say.
The right way and the wrong way.
Like I always say --
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
What is it?
Sounds reasonable.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
Smugglers maybe.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Better than starving to death.
I feel fine.
Lights?
No.
Because of the gold.
You're a pal.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Hell yeah.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Then why didn't they take it.
You mean, before she sank.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Could be a fishing boat.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Morning everybody.
What's slow?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
So you killed them?
You killed them.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
We hit land.
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
They went crazy.
Over the gold.
What do you think?
What do we do with him?
Epps? You there?
Nope.
Epps, over.
Just lucky I guess.
I don't know.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
That much I think we've already established.
Victims of what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Showing you what?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
No. Someone else. A girl. I'm not sure she was... real.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
The what?
What do you think happened on this boat?
Couldn't sleep.
Hey.
It's not gonna hold us.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The same day she supposedly went down.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
Smashed it up pretty bad.
What?
Only something must've gone wrong.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Same. Any luck?
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up. Keep an eye on him.
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
You just shoot at something?
Murphy to Epps.
Got your light?
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
You sure it wasn't me?
Are you sure?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
What guy?
Who?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Why not call for help?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
You're more practical than superstitious.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
So what did happen?
Nope.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have. Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
She was sailing up north, right?
What'd you find up there?
Coffee?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Go on.
Candy?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it. You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Leave it.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Can't find the shotgun.
He took the shotgun and a light.
We're still drifting.
A what?
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
You've been out for about a day.
You don't remember?
Lost my sea legs.
Drink up then.
Maybe.
And look what happened.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat. Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser. The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
I don't know.
Greer?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece. What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
We could call for help.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Ho, baby!
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
You're up late.
Yeah.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
We've done it before.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Murphy, goddamit.
How's that?
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Looks like it's adrift.
Alright. I'll be right up.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
I must be in the wrong business.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Let the buyer beware.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Greer to Murphy.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
You're kidding, right?
Fifteen, at the most.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Better late than never.
JUST DO IT!
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
About what?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
What?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Are you still looking for a job?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
God, how horrifying.
Not the Maxine?
YES.
Who?
How should I know?
Who?
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Will you get off my back for once?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
We're almost done. Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Dana! Hi! Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you. I had to give it to someone else... But I'm sure next year I can --
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
I...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
...wow...
Hmm.
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Uh-oh.
I'm not sure... I mean... I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I see... interesting...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Who is this, Enid?
And what can you tell us about this...
It's not optional!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Hey Josh.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Why do you have that stupid poster?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
That's just the way I am!
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Then why do you hate me so much?
"Yeah, right"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Why?
I guess.
Can I come in?
Yeah, well... hi...
Hi.
You need counseling.
No.
Forget it.
Jesus, look at this guy.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
No.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Wow... finally.
Do you want anything?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Hi.
I dunno...
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
There.
It's fine.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Hello?
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I said "great"...
Great...
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Nothing.
He came into work.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Just some people from work...
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
How repulsive!
What happened to Seymour?
Hello?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
What thing?
You're insane.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
God, you're really obsessed...
Go ahead...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday... Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Yeah, thanks.
Don't worry.
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment... Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
...maybe we should be lesbos...
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers! Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Which one?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Like what?
Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He does that every single day.
You cunt!
No way... when?
Where?
Where did you get that?
Wait...
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
It's a surprise.
I know a party we could go to...
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
How about this?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Everybody's too stupid!
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
It'll only take a second.
Should we leave a note?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
JOSH!
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
As always.
"Hassle"?
Where are we going?
It's always closed...
Fuck you, bitch!
What? How long have you been standing there?
Just promise you'll do it.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
"Funky"?
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Not really...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one ...Oh wait... you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
That was truly pathetic.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Ew, look at this...
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter... Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
He's insane!
Are you sure?
Do you think he knows?
What's he doing now?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
It's obviously him!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
SHUT UP!
I want to "make love" to him.
Look, maybe that's him!
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Shh, it's his answering machine... We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
Why do I always have to do it?
Oh yeah.
Which loser?
Fuck you!
What are you talking about -- who?
I want to do him!
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I remember every minute of that party.
What a little hosebag.
I've been looking all over for this.
Hey - why do you have this?
What is this?
So what should we do?
Does Oomie really like this show?
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Gross.
You can have that one.
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
You loser!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Hey, look at this...
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
In fact, never.
We should follow them!
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Just look at them!
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
How perfect.
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Forget it...
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
You loser.
Why?
What?
It's totally sickening. Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Oh, hey Enid... So... we finally made it!
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Nothing.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
May I ask what you're doing?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid. I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out... What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
You still interested in that?
Who does?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you. Absolutely no practice necessary. You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
How much is this?
A what?
Go die, asshole!
That tape sucked, by the way!
+++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
+++$+++ If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
+++$+++ Punk rock is over!
+++$+++ Didn't they tell you?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
...are you waiting for a bus?
Hi... what's your name?
Hey, where are you going?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
I did too!
Did you bring that tape?
You're late, asshole.
God, fuck you!
Well why do I care about that?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
What?
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
I was just thinking out loud... I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Yeah, well... me neither...
No... forget it...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
God, Dana's going to kill you!
I-I-I...
What do you want?
I dunno, I...
So where would we go?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
What?
Yeah, well I like you too...
What about Joe?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I hate sports.
I'm just being realistic.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What about this?
Do you have anything to drink?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Can you at least let me in?
I had to see you.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
In whatever way you think I mean.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Does that mean you don't like me?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
What's her problem anyway? Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
And you like them?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
...I better not...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I dunno... okay, I guess... I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Sounds good...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Boo!
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
What? You're kidding me...
So, what happened?
Hi, it's me...
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Wow! What was that all about?
Aren't you going to get that?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Never mind, it's way too complicated... Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Never...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
What, like a girdle?
What is that?
Are you okay?
No, Doofus... blow it out!
You can open your eyes now.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
What? Why?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
For nineteen years...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
What, are you a klansman or something?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
"Yet."
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar... At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
It's not hopeless...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Jesus...
What did you tell that girl?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Yes, that would certainly do...
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
So, why did you bring this along?
Relax, Seymour, relax...
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Shh!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
PLEASE? We have to!
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please?
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one... Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Every guy has a type!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I'm totally serious!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
God, look at this poster! I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Really? Can I see it?
You're right about that. So this is your record collection?
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
NO!!!
Watch my stuff.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Okay.
How much is it?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Is this one any good?
Sure, I guess.
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Indian records?
Right.
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
They're Seymour's.
No problem.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records? She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Call me sometime.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I agree.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Please Josh?
Right, exactly!
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
Talk to us about it...
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves. We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class. Who is responsible for this?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
That slut!
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe she was just hiding from you.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
She's not at home?
Do you have a check for me?
Seymour?
Thank you, doctor.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You think you matter? -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
There is no reason for fear.
Let me see the sick.
You were contracted to work-
How; we don't know where they are?
I think it's been a pleasure.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
I am a man of peace.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair? Told you you'd hate me.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it. Professional hunters may be the answer.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
In point of fact, it didn't. But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
What have they done besides kill Starling? How many have they killed?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Well, I need to speak to him.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I've brought them. Is he here?
I do need to see Starling.
Truthfully? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
Don't they, though?
How could it be? I hate Africa.
You won't have the chance. Any further words of encouragement? Then I've a train to catch.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Games? Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont. Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. Winning personality, heaps of charm?
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey. With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Well, he got away, didn't he? Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it." That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
That's a terrible idea-
Go, now. Such a gentleman.
What if there are complications?-
-well, it's just... ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
+++$+++ I assure you we came close many times-
+++$+++ -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
+++$+++ That is correct. Nothing.
+++$+++ We have hunted since childhood.
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor. My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands. I like the blood, is that strange?
What a good week.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now. There's even less of him than of Singh.
That's what the books say...
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
John, it will not be easy.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- -"there."
Possibly.
How lucky we are.
With much more on the way- -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
...one shot...
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Shhh.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced. Why not, indeed!
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I don't suppose I could watch.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
Does he speak English?
Have you got that in writing?
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Almost three hours. But I've been getting ready all my life.
Just that they fart through their mouths. Must make kissing something of a gamble.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse. And I'm one of his defenders. Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.
Many thanks. You're Patterson, yes? Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
The most of any lions... a hundred...? Probably more. Johnny...?
Because I think they're after you.
Good luck.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear?
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there. Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Don't they have to be?...
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- -they're doing it for pleasure.
I got big.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place. But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem. One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone. Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I suppose... ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and...
But of course yours worked.
It's all right. Stay ready. They know it's there.
Only in life...
Think about something else.
Has it ever done that before?
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Have you got it?
That's very considerate.
Somehow I guessed.
Actually, no.
We need to talk.
Got me out of trouble.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Afraid of lions.
Where is it?
He has children?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Thank you. Why does he need you by him?
You've known him long?
You like him, don't you?
Soon.
I do, actually; very much.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Thank you, Samuel.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two. And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? It means "slaughter"...
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
This is more difficult-
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge.
Hold your son high.
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now. You two will sleep beautifully in your tents. And stay there.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Why so many?
Four should do it.
I don't believe you had a mother.
I'd rather not.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul. I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
We don't have a relationship.
I don't care who he is. He's not taking my baby.
Everybody has a choice.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
What do you want with my baby?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Okay, just thought I'd check. Good night, Dana. Sleep well. Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Do you need anything? You want me to come in?
Janosz?
I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.
Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
I won't.
Certainly.
No. Not that I can recall.
Venkman? I think he was borderline for a while there. Then he crossed the border.
Occasionally
Oh no.
We'll do the happiness index next. I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
What are you working on, Egon?
Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Okay, that's no problem.
Didn't I do it?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Thank you, Frank. I'll get the hang of this eventually.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
That's a terrible thing to say.
That's not true. It was 1620.
I think he likes you. I think I do too.
Maybe I should call Janine.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Why do you say things like that? You're so much better than you know.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had to protect myself. You really weren't very good for me, you know.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I have a hamper? Next time ask me first, okay. I have more than two grades of laundry. There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding? Do I have a vase? I brought some of your clothes. Wear something intriguing. I brought along some interesting possibilities.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's one of my most valuable employees.
Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it.
Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything at my apartment?
I'll put him down for you. You are way too short! And your belly-button sticks out! You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Or we could do that.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me. If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free. In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub. You better stay here.
Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts. But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. Are we having a pajama party?
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here. I'll call you. Later, Johnny!
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting. I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
You're really good, you know.
So this is what you do, huh?
Good luck.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.
I wish I could stay. I feel personally responsible for you being here.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it? There's our old cash machine. And the dry cleaners we used to go to. And the old video store. We really had some good times, didn't we?
I'll do it.
Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
His name is Oscar.
What do you think?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
He didn't "ditch" me. We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot. Let's go to work, boys.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped.
Hi, Egon.
Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I can't be sure, Peter.
I received this information from an alien. I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking. Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Look, I've had it with you. Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here. This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
That's quite a story.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about. We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just want to say hello to him.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
You're very brave, Louis. Good luck.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do they know you're doing this?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Tonight?
Okay.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right. I can finish this later if you're tired.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
That's very practical. I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Have you made any plans yet? You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
What are you doing up here?
Ghostbusters.
Don't worry. We're not moving. He is.
What is it, honey?
You pitiful, miserable creatures! You dare to challenge the power of darkness? Don't you realize what you are dealing with? He's Vigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
The Upper West Side.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list. Your name was first.
I know.
My pleasure.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.

It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition. It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian. He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Pleasure to meet you. I've seen you on television.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong. I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
I await the word of Vigo.
-- the sorrow --
Yes, the scourge --
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood. What was will be, what is will be no more. Now is the season of evil. Find me a child that I might live again.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
These boys aren't playing around.
They're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them for murder. They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48. Now they want to kill me.
You've got to do something!
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
That's it? That's all you have to say?
Get on with it, counselor!
Yes.
Do I?
Okay, let me rephrase that question. Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I let them handle all the little stuff. I just come in on the big ones.
Hey! Wait! Okay, I'll meet you there.
This is my cousin Sherman. Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters. I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back. It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Come on, Sherm. You're my cousin. Do this for me. I'm begging you.
This is not just some money-making scheme! I didn't just make up the date. I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway. That's where we come in.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.
From where -- Neptune?
Pretty impressive, huh?
So far so good.
It's working. The positive GeV's are climbing.
Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters. Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
That's it? "I'll be back?"
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Yeah, you would. Is that for personal or professional reasons?
I don't even want to know where that is.
How've you been? How's teaching? I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
Egon!
Don't shoot! You'll hit Ray!
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you. But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg. We just have to mobilize it.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had it with you.
Nine feet -- ten --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
No, not exactly a man of the people. "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
I'm Egon --
Hey, I didn't imagine it. There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
Good idea.
This one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Who was that?
Late Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Rivers of the stuff!
Is the line sinking?
There's definitely something going on in that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
What's your story, Pete?
My great-grandparents were Swiss. I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
My Fault!
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Forget it. The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Yeah, sorry I missed it. I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Darn it! I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
Don't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
What happened?
Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish up and get out of here.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
'Mood slime.' We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
This is what you do with your spare time?
And now you're going to eat it?
Oh good, you're here. Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Hold on, Ray! Half-price! Have you gone crazy?
I'm Peter --
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Relax. We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
I love this. We're onto something really big. I can smell it, Ray. We're going to make some headlines with this one.
What's that?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Who, Ray?
Who? Who? Who?
Who? Just -- someone we know.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Uh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.
I knew that voice sounded familiar. What's up? How's it going?
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Groovy. I've never felt better in my life.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty. Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Don't you see? It's the slime. That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Oh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead and try it.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Yeah, I guess so. It was the strangest thing. I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop. This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all. Whew! Sorry, boys.
Well don't think!
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right? You coming down with something?
You finished here?
Now that's one ugly dude.
You got a flux and a half.
And he didn't die of old age either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Does it have any favorites?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Give it up, Ray. You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
That's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
I'm ready.
Miss Blue Blood? Her family's been here since the year 12.
It's okay. I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
If she's naked under that toga. She's French, you know.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
And pure --
It better not start yet. I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Tell him about the toaster.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
What's the matter, dear?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Roy? Your clock broke.
I don't know. It probably would've been the same.
I was just going to say "eight." You're fantastic!
Okay. Just give me a second here. I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Well, you're doing great. Keep it up.
Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Ready? What is it?
Is it a star?
I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
I am Zuul.
I got the Twister game for later ...
Great! Bring her, too. But you better hurry. I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone. I'll make some more though.
Hey, it's crazy in here. You're missing a classic party.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Okay. I'll take a raincheck. I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that. Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients. It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant. I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, no, I feel great. I just ordered some more vitamins. I see you were exercising. So was I. I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
This is going to cost you, you know. Our fees are ridiculously high.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.
Nothing! We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
There is no Dana. I am Zuul.
I am Zuul. I am ...
I want you inside me.
Take me now.
Do you want this body?
He is the Destructor.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Hey, Dana. What is it? What happened?
I'll pick you up at your place. I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients? I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I'm checking on that. I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion. One of their gods.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I'll cancel the reservation, I found the name "Zuul" in ... The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects. I don't suppose you've read it.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Is he dying or something?
Who's the stiff?
I don't have to take abuse from you. I have other people dying to give it to me.
You're the best one in your row.
Great rehearsal.
Goodbye.
All right.
Then leave.
I'll scream.
Out!
That's it. Get out.
All right. What do you want to do?
Thanks. Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Yeah, yeah.
Damn!
I told you, I ...
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Uh-huh.
What?
Thanks. What's in there?
No? What do I act like?
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You play the cello! It's my favorite instrument.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Is that your professional opinion?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone. There was nothing there.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Hello. I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?
+++$+++ Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind. You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle." Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable. You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
+++$+++ Fine. This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
+++$+++ No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS. The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.
+++$+++ That would definitely explain it.
+++$+++ You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
+++$+++ Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
+++$+++ He's a big one. You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
We'll get back to you.
Back off, man! I'm a scientist!
One thing at a time. We don't even know what it is yet.
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Thank you.
I don't believe in luck.
What is it?
That's so romantic.
In the physical sense.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man. I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you. I'm afraid you're going to die.
I think it's the food of the future.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Is that a game?
Print is dead.
Oh, really? Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
I didn't ask him. All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job. She paid with a Visa card.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it. Hold all my calls, Janine.
Heavens, no! The owners don't like us to even talk about it. I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Thank you for coming so quickly. The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
That's "Peck!"
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
See! They are using drugs.
Forget it, Venkman. You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me. Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Hey! Make yourself useful! Go save a tree!
Go ahead! Get a court order. Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Why do you want to see it?
The magic word is "please."
Because you didn't say the magic word.
No, you may not.
Yes, it would.
In a storage facility.
I'm not at liberty to say.
You could say that.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
Great! How's it going?
Can I help you?
I'll tell you the effect! It pisses me off!
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. What are you trying to prove?
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this.
Two wavy lines?
Yes. I don't like this.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Good guess -- but no.
All right. What is it?
On Earth -- no. But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
I couldn't do that. You might hurt someone.
They're not guns. They're particle throwers.
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Were you recently in the bathroom?
But it's my favorite state.
No! You said crossing the beams would be BAD. It'll kill her! And us!
On the count of three! One ... Two ...
What now?
You talked to Gozer?
Who?
Yes. After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Of course! Ivo Shandor, I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE. He started a secret society in 1920.
Where's the Keymaster?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
You have to keep him there. Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave, He could be very dangerous.
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking. It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I don't think so. It's more of that Gozer thing. She says she's the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
It's Peter, Egon. I've got a problem.
What do you mean "bad?"
Why not?
What?
Yeah, I can smell it.
Didn't see anything, Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost. I'm starting to worry. You said your graph was pointing to something big. You told me things were going to start popping.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Wow!
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Oh! You're here.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Look at the structure of the roof cap. It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
What happened??!!!?
I need two new purge valves. How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Neutronize. System shut.
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
God, it's ugly!
We'd better adjust our streams.
I blame myself.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious. And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Great! The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
What? What popped in there?
Forget the trapping! Just blast him!
Well, that ought to do it.
I don't think it's Shandor.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
No! Nobody ever built them like this! The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius. The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
It's not good, Pete.
I can't take much more of this. The pace is killing me.
I don't know. I'm just guessing.
Don't move. It won't hurt you.
Well, hurry up. The needle's going wild.
Third floor. Get down here,
Ray -- Something's here.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sure. Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back. No problem.
So do I.
They will.
How was your date?
Why don't I check out the building? It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Do you think it's wide enough? How much?
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think? We're trying to keep our costs down. You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Maybe. But no one ever advertised before.
But at nineteen percent interest! You didn't even bargain with the guy.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
To go into business for ourselves.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason. Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever. I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
You're always so worried about your reputation. We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Ray, I apologize. I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced. They did this to Galileo, too.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys. You never would've met if not for me. That's got to be worth something.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
I guess I got a little overexcited. Wasn't it incredible! I'm telling you, this is a first. You know what this could mean to the University?
Okay. Okay. I got it. I know what to do. Stay close. I have a plan.
Anything! Just make contact.
I don't know. Talk to it.
I told you it's real.
What is it?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
What do you mean by "seen?"
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years. The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.
Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?
What's he talking about? Choose what?
Stantz? You okay in there?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Judgement Day ...
And the seas would boil ...
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
No. But I liked Jesus' style.
Boy! Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Mmmhmmm.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Yeah, I heard that. Now tell me what you really do.
What have I got now? It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds. He is their champion.
Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Lykas, pick a man. Someone who will look good. Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Not yet, dear brother...
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
"... by the emperor of Rome. This writer asks: between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
What are you talking about?
The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother. The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
I have to come back. If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward. Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand. Do you understand?
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Kill him! Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
For the gods, spit it out!
How about in the forum. Right in front of the Senate.
It's disgusting! Animals! I had to come here under armed guard. Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Those are priceless sculptures.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with. Forget about him.
Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Quite so. Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Where are we now, Commodus? Can you see the camp? My Gods! The air is turning into ice!
Endorse me in public. Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates. I know you would give anything to be outside again. Endorse me and you will be free. Think of it. What would you do with your freedom?
The army is a problem. They love you. You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you. And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that? Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you.
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people? Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Caesar?
You flatter me, Caesar.
Do we really need to repair this fort? It seems like an expensive undertaking. I propose we burn it to the ground. That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political. Not a Republican by any chance?
Or perhaps into a new one. But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Then you'd be out of a job.
That's difficult to say, general.
Of course, but not now. However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas. My father sends his heart felt praise. Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Take grain away from the army?
Give away food?
So am I.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum. If it's my father they want then give him to them!
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least. I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Gods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is this going to go on?
Ignore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
How can they? Who else is there? I have no heir...
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory. They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
You don't want to kill him. If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress. It would take the army to break in there. What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he? He's gone. And you are a hero for awarding it.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Gladly, Caesar. And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Yes, Caesar.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
Caesar, I did my best. The Colosseum isn't under my control...
He must have been. He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
You know there were riots last night. Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division. You understand what you are doing...
AGH! Please! He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to? And don't tell me you don't know!
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens." The Emperor's going to fight in the arena. I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
This is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the Daily Action. I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
That's their job, isn't it? To argue. So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
I've read of it.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome. God of my ancestors.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear. If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both. We needed to know what you believed.
We all know what right is, Senator.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes. At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
You're a citizen and a soldier. Not a gladiator.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial? You'd have to give me your word.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Who are you? Narcissus The Good? I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
Is this Rome? Are we just going to be executed?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Why you?
Hidden. Where my brother cannot place hands on them. He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all. The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
You cannot die.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman. Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night. My beautiful daughters.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something. If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something! These men here are butchered for laughs! Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Yours will do!
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperor himself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front? Burning patriotism? Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
How do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you know me better than my father. He's going to die, isn't he?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little embarrassing.
Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
You know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
+++$+++ They fear change. The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible. You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
+++$+++ The Senators admire you.
+++$+++ A man should be upright, not be kept upright. History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute. I want you to consider becoming my heir.
+++$+++ Everyone talking about it? I wouldn't wonder. All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate. Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators. This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan. It's a start, only a start. If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share. This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
+++$+++ It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man. That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
+++$+++ If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago. And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
+++$+++ Servis made it through again?
+++$+++ I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus. We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
+++$+++ I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
On my honor as your daddy...
As soon as I can.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome? I can end this madness now! Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
You brought the army into Rome.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here. The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me. I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
My troops don't make policy.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Serious stuff...
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
What the hell was all that about?
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
You teach them!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I don't want you to die!
Narcissus!
You're not going! You have to stay with us!
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family. You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Let him trust Quintus.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Who else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you!
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
If you win, you know, you have to stay. It's the losers who get to go home. Besides, I'm not so sure it is over. Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I can see that...
Of course...
What about their philosophy lessons?
Greeks?
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Are you mad? With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night! Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you?
Let's talk about this later. Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia. From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum. It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean. Rich soil. Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
I'll do it! Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer. I don't want to get sued over this.
Fantastic! Wonderful! But posters are very expensive.
I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Oh, shit. Take your time! Don't get suckered! This man is a murderer! In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators. Please, just take the fall!
On you! Of course! You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
It's absolutely not like that! This is for your own good! Come on get the rest of your armor on!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third! When I get paid... just take the fall! You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
You get to come alive again in the country!
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood. Gushes out everywhere! It's really impressive. Fantastic! Better than the real thing!
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer: you take a fall.
No more bad luck now! The people are anticipating you! I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman! The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight. A fan sent them to you.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
That's one way to look at it.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
I'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight.
-- to fight? We'll see...
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here. I know what you're trying to do: kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands. The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual. You make me feel good about my investment! And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you. Both of you have clamped mouths! But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family. And about you. That I promise.
Take your hands off me animal!
Death is a very light thing for you.
Thank you. What is going to happen tomorrow? Exactly?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate. I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me. I own this school and everything that's in it. You're in it! But why? What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets. Please, I separated you from the others because... ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
I'm a Greek, thank you. And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians. Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white. Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...? and you act like one. What was your crime?
Benjamin?
The day after tomorrow?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Shhhh.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No, Benjamin.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Yes.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Carl who?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
I just don't think it would...
Why wouldn't it?
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
You really will?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
We just can.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't know.
Yes.
I might.
I don't know.
Will you kiss me!
Benjamin?
But Elaine --
I don't understand.
Well -- where are you going?
Are you going home?
What are you going to do now?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.
My belt.
If you want.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Then what?
I don't feel well.
Why?
Let me go.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
I don't understand --
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
Elaine -- I love you.
All right then! Yes!
I think it is.
Is it because I'm here?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I want to ask you a question.
What?
-- really incredible --
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
But you're not enrolled.
Yes.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
No.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Where are you meeting this person?
I'm meeting someone.
Don't cry.
No -- don't cry --
Elaine --
You mean the one who --
What?
What is it?
Why aren't you ready?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What's the matter?
You do?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You sure you really want to?
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
I'm glad.
And it's all over now.
Did they ever find out?
With a family?
Was she married or something?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Yes.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Of course not.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Where we going?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Wait a minute.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Yes, I do.
No.
No, I couldn't.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I just want to tell you something.
But, Elaine --
I'm sorry I took you in there.
No.
I don't know.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Why not?
Aren't you eating?
Do you want some dinner?
Do you always drive like this?
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you know what you're going to do?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Hello.
Thank you.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Hello -- who is this?
+++$+++ Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
+++$+++ There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
+++$+++ Plastics.
+++$+++ Are you listening?
+++$+++ Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
+++$+++ Ben.
+++$+++ Ben!
Could I make one phone call first?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
What for?
Mr. McCleery?
+++$+++ All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Oh -- no sir.
What?
Ahhh.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Not exactly.
VOICE +++$+++ I'll be there in an hour.
VOICE +++$+++ Give me an hour.
VOICE +++$+++ Did you get a room?
VOICE +++$+++ Where are you?
VOICE +++$+++ Where are you?
VOICE +++$+++ Benjamin?
VOICE +++$+++ Hello.
VOICE +++$+++ All right. Put it in the room where we were.
VOICE +++$+++ Will you bring it in to me?
VOICE +++$+++ For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
VOICE +++$+++ Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Well here's the purse.
Mrs. Robinson?
VOICE +++$+++ Will you bring up my purse before you go?
VOICE +++$+++ BENJAMIN?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
+++$+++ Of course.
+++$+++ Sir?
+++$+++ Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
+++$+++ Where is your luggage?
+++$+++ Where is it?
+++$+++ Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?
+++$+++ Is anything wrong, sir?
A single. Just for myself, please.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Ahh -- thank you.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
What?
+++$+++ Can I help you, sir!
I'll find her.
What the hell have you done?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
What have you done to her?
Where is Elaine?
I just don't believe you would do that.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I don't believe you.
How?
Mrs. Robinson --
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
+++$+++ But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
+++$+++ Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
This is absurd.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
+++$+++ Thank you.
+++$+++ May I stay then?
+++$+++ You don't have to say that.
+++$+++ But if it's sickening for you --
+++$+++ That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
+++$+++ If that's how you feel --
+++$+++ Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
+++$+++ Of course I wouldn't.
+++$+++ I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
+++$+++ Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
+++$+++ Did I say that?
+++$+++ Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
+++$+++ Are you?
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Well, I'm not.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ I have my reasons.
+++$+++ Good.
+++$+++ Good.
+++$+++ Do you understand that?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
+++$+++ There's nothing to tell.
+++$+++ Because I don't want you to.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Don't talk about Elaine.
+++$+++ That's enough.
+++$+++ It was a Ford, Benjamin.
+++$+++ Oh my God.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ I don't think we were the first.
+++$+++ We'd go to his car.
+++$+++ Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
+++$+++ How do you think.
+++$+++ Kind of.
Art?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
What was your major?
At college.
And you were a student also.
+++$+++ Not particularly.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ All right. Now let's get to bed.
+++$+++ Are you shocked?
+++$+++ Don't tell Elaine.
+++$+++ Think real hard, Benjamin.
+++$+++ See if you can guess.
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
What?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
+++$+++ Is it?
+++$+++ I don't.
+++$+++ No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
+++$+++ Not exactly.
+++$+++ We've talked enough, Benjamin.
+++$+++ Is it?
+++$+++ On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
+++$+++ Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ About five years.
+++$+++ No we don't.
+++$+++ We don't.
+++$+++ Thank you.
+++$+++ Can I undress and talk at the same time?
+++$+++ Calm down, Benjamin.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ The driveway's on my side of the house.
+++$+++ Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
+++$+++ Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
+++$+++ He's asleep.
You walk right out the door.
How do you get out of the house?
+++$+++ There isn't any.
+++$+++ Him?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
What novel did you read.
What one.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
+++$+++ I got up.
+++$+++ Do you really want me to?
+++$+++ Can I take off my clothes now?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
You're not interested in art?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
+++$+++ Go ahead then.
+++$+++ Don't you?
+++$+++ You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
+++$+++ How about art.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Oh my God.
Anything. Anything at all.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
+++$+++ -- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
+++$+++ That you're afraid --
+++$+++ On your first time --
+++$+++ It's nothing to be ashamed of --
+++$+++ You can admit that, can't you?
+++$+++ It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
+++$+++ Benjamin, is this your first time?
+++$+++ Are you afraid of me?
+++$+++ Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
+++$+++ You what?
+++$+++ Would this be easier for you in the dark?
+++$+++ Thank you.
+++$+++ Either one will be fine.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ A hanger.
+++$+++ Will you bring me a hanger?
+++$+++ Why don't you watch?
+++$+++ I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
+++$+++ Benjamin.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
What?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
To tell you?
Yes?
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
I got a single room.
+++$+++ Why don't you get it.
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ Do you want to get it now?
+++$+++ Do you want me to get it?
+++$+++ Do you want to?
+++$+++ Have you gotten us a room yet?
+++$+++ Did you get us a room?
+++$+++ You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
He didn't see me.
+++$+++ May I have a drink?
+++$+++ How are you?
+++$+++ May I sit down?
+++$+++ Hello, Benjamin.
Yes.
I've got to go.
+++$+++ Because I find you very attractive and any time --
+++$+++ Do you understand what I said?
+++$+++ If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
+++$+++ Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
+++$+++ I want to say something first.
+++$+++ Don't be nervous.
Where is it?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
What?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
But they would! Don't you see?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
+++$+++ Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
+++$+++ Then why do you keep running away?
+++$+++ What are you so scared of?
+++$+++ Thank you.
I know that. But I'm --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
+++$+++ Will you unzip my dress?
+++$+++ Benjamin?
Very much.
No.
Her portrait?
What is wrong with me?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Aren't you?
+++$+++ So?
+++$+++ Well I don't know.
+++$+++ Like what?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ What's wrong?
+++$+++ Pardon?
+++$+++ My husband will be back quite late.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Sit down, Benjamin.
+++$+++ Did you know that?
+++$+++ Did you know I was an alcoholic?
+++$+++ You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
+++$+++ What do you think of me?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
+++$+++ Drink?
When is he coming back?
Why not?
+++$+++ What do you drink?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
+++$+++ Please.
+++$+++ Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
What for?
What?
Right.
Let's go.
You don't?
What?
What?
That's right.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Is what a girl?
+++$+++ Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
+++$+++ Is there an ashtray in here?
+++$+++ How are you, Benjamin?
+++$+++ Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
I say I've got it.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
+++$+++ I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
We haven't.
About an hour ago.
No -- they don't.
+++$+++ Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
+++$+++ -- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
+++$+++ Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
+++$+++ It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Goodnight, Benjamin.
+++$+++ But I don't want you to make up something.
+++$+++ Not if you don't want to.
+++$+++ Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Well, wait.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
+++$+++ Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
Meet someone?
Oh, no.
Nothing else.
I drive around.
+++$+++ You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
+++$+++ Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
+++$+++ Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
+++$+++ Can I talk to you a minute?
+++$+++ Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
+++$+++ Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
+++$+++ She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
+++$+++ Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
+++$+++ Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
+++$+++ Say that again.
That has nothing to do with it --
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
+++$+++ Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
+++$+++ Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
+++$+++ Have you thought about graduate school?
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ To be what?
+++$+++ What about it?
+++$+++ About what?
+++$+++ -- worried?
+++$+++ I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
+++$+++ Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
+++$+++ Don't shout at me, Ben.
+++$+++ Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
+++$+++ That's quite a statement.
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
+++$+++ You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
+++$+++ Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
+++$+++ Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
+++$+++ Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
+++$+++ Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
+++$+++ Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
+++$+++ Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
+++$+++ What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
+++$+++ Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
+++$+++ That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
+++$+++ Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
I will.
Oh yes.
+++$+++ What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
+++$+++ You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
I'd like to hear it.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Quite a while.
+++$+++ How long have we known each other now?
+++$+++ Ben, can I say something to you?
+++$+++ You'll never be young again.
+++$+++ I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
+++$+++ That's a hell of a good age to be.
+++$+++ Ben -- how old are you now?
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
I've got to go.
Oh no.
Yes, sir.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
+++$+++ Can you see me now?
+++$+++ Benjamin -- where are you?
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ Hello.
+++$+++ Dad -- can you listen --
+++$+++ This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
+++$+++ I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
+++$+++ Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
+++$+++ Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
+++$+++ I don't believe it.
+++$+++ What's happening?
+++$+++ They came all the way from Tarzana.
+++$+++ The Carlsons' are here.
+++$+++ Is anything wrong?
+++$+++ It's a short life and a gay one...
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
I oughtn't to presume, but I -- I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
+++$+++ Turn 'em up.
You might find a bullet through that head...
How?
What about the money?
You can't.
With the pearls --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I don't like your tone.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
No -- no -- no -- no...
How?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
No --
No.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
The pearls are in her room.
Yes.
Well?
Yes, sir.
I want to speak --
Time's getting short.
Have you a minute now?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Oh!
You live here?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Going?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
I feel sorry for him.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Will you do me a big favor?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Money.
Chasing around.
I'd given you up.
We'll dance.
Of course.
You're very funny --
Where downstairs?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Free --
Aren't you?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Very little.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
No -- why? -- should I?
Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Dictation. You know...
Oh -- work!!
That.
Have you seen it?
Who?
Yes, I am rather.
Never?
Like dancing?
Till then.
On the train?
I'm worried about you.
Why?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
I can't.
Bless you...
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Why later?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Very early in the morning.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Yes.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
I couldn't go through with it. Remarkable.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I know.
I don't want them now.
Oh --
What is the matter?
That's a silly joke.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
And what do you do -- now?
And?
No?
Really?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
I want to be alone.
What?
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
You are beautiful!
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
I should like to smoke.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Just for a minute then.
I want to be alone --
I want to be alone.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Go away. Who are you --?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
Strange man...
Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Yes -- tired...
And -- and --
And then --?
Why do you look at me like that?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Goodnight, Kringelein.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
I take five hundred.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I've no luck.
That was my last.
All right then.
Is that too much, Baron?
Ready, Kringelein?
We could come to my room.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just -- Well -- well --
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
A little strange, Baron.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Yes, quite.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
General Director Preysing! Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Oh, a Baron!
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Thank you, sir.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Yes -- but the audience.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Hello! Hello! --
Be quiet.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. Stay here... Give me that money.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I did not ask your advice.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
Most imposters are --
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I don't know.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
And the child isn't coming?
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
No, doctor.
Nobody, Doctor.
No, Doctor.
No, Doctor.
No.
No -- I must find it -- Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
Oh, I've got to find it.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. Oh, the pain.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Everything?
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
What, Doctor?
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
But Doctor --
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Oh -- but -- I --
Oh!
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Am I!
Do you like me better?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know -- I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Yes, of course, -- money!
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
What's the matter?
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Oh -- what -- what --
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
I never danced before -- in public.
Yes.
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Oh -- you would!
A man might what?
You like music?
No - absinthe.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Oh, don't go.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know. And these are real silk drapes.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Why not?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Here, hold up!
You think so?
I had to arrange about the trip.
Well, he's a gentleman!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh, yes.
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Of course -- of course.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I must go to England -- at once.
Yes.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Tomorrow morning.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Hello!
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.
Definitely off.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
...weight into the balance...
Cotton Company --
I understand you perfectly.
You're a little too fast.
Not too quickly.
No.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke? I went to Florence once, too.
Perhaps.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
That's from skiing.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover...
Me.
I got ten marks for that.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Moreover...
You pay me.
No -- only occasional jobs.
Moreover...
Moreover --
Then you will please wait outside.
What...! --
What we want to know about is Manchester.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Preysing, you're joking with us.
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
What?
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Then, it's all over?
You've decided against the merger?
What?
Evil days -- I've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Scratched -- We did not take the initiative.
We did not approach you.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
No water -- What a place!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
What?
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
...and let me say again for the tenth time... ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
How clear is Manchester?
You're a deep one.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Shall I tell them again?
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Madam should sleep.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Good morning, Madam.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Let us cancel the engagement.
I can't dance tonight --
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance. I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life. Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Hurry, Suzette.
Take them back, Suzette.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Last night?... There was no applause.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
It is time for the performance.
Again?
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
We must call the police, your excellency.
Yes, I know them --
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Yes, the police must be called.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
Me?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Go away -- go away.
What is this insolence?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
I could not think of not accepting.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
Just one moment, sir.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.
You are late. Hurry.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Pretty as a picture.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
What do you want with her?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What you need is some relaxation.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
What's bluff?
What's the matter with you?
Next week.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Good night.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
I know -- I know.
No. No word.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
You know it, Lilly.
You're a thousand percent right!
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You'll never shit right again.
What's that, Lilly?
And if you do it wrong?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You ever hear about the oranges?
No.
You're calling the shots.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You expect me to buy this?
Motherhood.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
Your what?
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Hi, Bobo.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Right in front of the room.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Want a look?
So here we are!
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has-- -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
These machines -- They're in here.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
You know who I work for.
Well, make it stop!
What? He's going to be all right!
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
I know.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
It's not your fault.
I'll get you a check.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you. Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Perk, remember?
Oh, come on, Roy.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
No?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
What's up?
Roy Dillon.
Hello.
NO!
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
A future. The only future I've got.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Well, uh...
I don't see why not.
I don't?
That's right.
No.
For God's sake, Lilly!
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
Never.
Uh-huh.
Not very good!
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
I'll get it.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You want a drink?
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
What?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
At what?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Just a few bucks.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
As though you do what I say.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Going somewhere?
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down. It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
No. That was the point.
You do?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
What's that?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Why?
I tripped over a chair.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Bluebell came in?
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
No. And you have to be.
How come?
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
I like those.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
What happened to your hand?
I guess I owe you my life.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Nice to see you. What am I doing in here?
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
They knocked out my tooth!
They twisted my arm.
We'll work something out, Joe.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
In your other hand.
I am in school.
I can't. I just left home.
Let me see how you did that one.
I didn't teach you that.
You watch that mouth.
What's that?
) What?
I'm happy the way I am.
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
That's what I say.
Don't I get any say in this?
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
What?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
She didn't see you, in other words.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You were gone for a while.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Open it and find out.
Open your door.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Think about it. Okay?
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Take a hike, you mean?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Atascadero.
Upstate.
He retired.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
Is that right?
I've heard the name.
Nobody does that single-o.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Myra, I'm not following this.
I'm a salesman.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
You already went back to work.
I'll sign that affidavit.
See you soon.
You ain't seen nothin.
We'll rent a car.
Because it's comfortable.
I'll see you when you get home.
Get well soon.
Oh, don't be stupid.
That's just Lilly's way.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Mama!
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
Her job.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
All? It ain't bad.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Mm?
Let's find out.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
That's that, then.
No question, huh?
Not many.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Ate the gun. Oh.
What?
Yes, I know, I know.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Not that it matters. This is the morgue?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Gun?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Thank you.
Yes?
Happy to see you looking so good.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Mr. Simms.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Carter.
Yes.
Come on, Carter. You know it's Michael.
That's it?
I can be real stiff.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
The cemetery...
It's Blake. Meet me at Grand View.
Girl scouts.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
No blood on the knife.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Right. So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis. Her home office was ransacked. It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers. It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
It's for your cigarette. I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again. Thanks for your concern. Goodbye.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective. The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Detective...
I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.
Do I know you?
+++$+++ Doesn't look good.
+++$+++ Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
+++$+++ Pretty messy. Parents have already been notified. Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
+++$+++ It's Amy Kramer.
+++$+++ Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown. We got a dead body in there.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver. It was a butcher knife.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
My office?
Nothing's missing?
You sure?
And miss the big game? No way.
Checking out your place.
No shit.
I think someone broke into my house.
My blood pleasure. You scared the hell out of me.
That would work.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Please, get on the bus...
John...
John, you can't help her now.
Just get on the bus.
Get on the bus.
I don't know.
I was trying to protect you from this...
No.
Yes.
Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Will, sit down...
Just forget it...
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?
I just went for a walk. It's no big deal.
Nothing.
I know.
I thought you'd never ask.
Where are you going?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My point exactly. See, we both agree.
Forget it.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top. Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
No.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom". Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
You're so predictable.
Yeah.
Here, take my jacket.
You look kind of cold.
You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Alright. I'll come out. Just be quiet.
Then I'll get caught.
Are you crazy? You'll get caught.
I can see that. Why?
What are you doing here?!
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Why not?
I borrowed it.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Shelve the barf bag. It's the key to the main gate.
Who?!
Okay... thank you.
I know. I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate. Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
Keri, you all right?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Yeah.
Never.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
I can't believe this is happening.
He's my brother.
Michael Meyers.
You're right. It does sound strange.
What?
I'm fine. I just need to lie down...
What?
Bye Will.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything?
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
It's not going to happen.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
It's always John.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
Looks great. It does.
Can't you?
I have to pee.
Wait.
Look, they're staring right at us.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Very insightful.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Thanks!
Nope. Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
You're so easy...
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Big time. And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
You're unbelievable.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
He gave me a fuckin' A? Wow.
I did alright.
He's in the bathroom.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
You mean Tommy. Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven. Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid. Messed up his head. He's harmless, though. Probably just lonely.
Why? You interested?
Pig. What the hell happened this time?
He do that to you?
Answer what?
Then they can watch.
Guess so ...
We can light our own tree at home.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Jesus, that's my neighbor. Tommy.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Hold on, hot lips. We got work to do.
Mommy!!!
Promise?
I can't. The voice man is coming to get me.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Come on, Mom. We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
No, Mom -- keep it on!
He says things. Bad things.
But I've seen him!
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
The voice man! He's here!
You knew, didn't you, John? You knew.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with. John, I want you to come with us.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
He told me about the terrible things that happened here. In our house.
What is it this time?
See what I'm talkin' about?
Relax, John. They were just kids.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family. And he won't stop until you are all destroyed. I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Found this morning. In a field outside Haddonfield. Stabbed.
This house is sacred to him. It's the source of his memories -- his rage. Mrs. Strode, I beg you. Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room. His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
Who are you?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's ... Michael ... ... Michael Myers!
No -- please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's not working!
Wait a minute ...
Kara, no!
He's gone.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Black magic ... 'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Not just Kyle. All of you. His entire family. Here. Look at this.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
God, what's wrong with him?
Do you know how insane this is? Who am I supposed to be looking for?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Leave the boy. Take me.
No!!!
You've created a monster.
Samhain.
Jamie's baby ...
Why did you take Jamie?
It was you.
This is madness, Wynn.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me. Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
I'll meet you over there.
Good. I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
An old friend.
I'm here now, Jamie. You're going to live. You have to.
It's a sign. He's come home.
Or what's left of him.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive. I feel him. I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him. Sitting behind these very same walls. Staring. Growing stronger. As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again. Not alone. I need your help to stop him.
It was Jamie Lloyd. She came back, as I knew she would one day. And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
It was her voice. On the radio. It was Jamie. Calling for me.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules. Just think it over.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Retiring.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me. And you're right. I've come to celebrate. After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said: 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
Christ, what a night! Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Run, Tommy!!! Run!!!
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life. She is the last of his blood line. If she dies --
What do you know about Michael?
Yes ... Tommy. What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Yes?
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy. That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up. I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb. I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
If I hadn't done it. If I'd said to myself, "Screw it. I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I don't think so. It could have been.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I know you think that.
Okay. Okay.
Me?
Yeah. I practically forgot. But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly. That belonged to everybody. Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun. After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
You never played a violin.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy. You know?
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him. You know?
Hi, Penelope.
I dunno.
I dunno. You know. I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Sorry. At least you've got a place to come back to. I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno.
He's a man. Tell him you're a man.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos. I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear. To our women.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Of course! Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform! Rent a uniform!
Sorry.
Really?
Oh. I'd forgotten.
When?
How do you know that?
He and his love are like a retiarius. Do you know what a retiarius is?
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
You know me, boy.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
The educational process.
How about breakfast, wife?
Could have happened to anybody.
Otherwise, how are things?
And how were things?
You're right! We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take. I don't want to talk about motorcycles. I don't want to talk about tits. Go home!
Go home!
I'm lonesome already.
Months?
You know what gets me? Those guys who went to the moon! To the moon, boy!
Good night, Colonel. It's been beautiful.
Let's talk about it some other time.
So long, Colonel.
That's the point! Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Go home.
Go home!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home! Show them how rich you are for a change!
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!
You're lucky, boy. My house is gonna be filled with people.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy. You come home, and nobody's here. When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
I didn't tell you everything.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I wish you'd tell Alice that. And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
At least we found the diamonds.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time. I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident. Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
You know what gets me?
Home.
I suppose.
Um.
No.
Home is important to a man.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel. Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap. I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Didn't recognize you.
It's a bitch.
I dunno, boy.
Thank God!
Out!
Out! Out!
Look how you're acting now! This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying. Slug me!
He can shoot! He can hold his ground! He can attack! You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
You're hollow, like a woman.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
To make an ass of yourself.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
For what?
What?
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit! Look after your things, your things!
Things. Oh--you silly people and your things. Things, things, things.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Fifty years?
I just want one true adventure before I die.
I've considered that.
Get used to it. Back door, Paul.
You actually sold insurance!
Pass the fucking catsup.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Blue soup.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends. Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
I forget mine for years on end.
You've come to the right man.
The posies are for her?
How are you, honeybunch?
Yeah. But it's going to get loud again.
I don't know what I hope. But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway. You don't know me. You don't know her, either. I don't think you know anybody. You talk to everybody just the same.
It's your house, Dad.
I don't want to fight you.
Too late! It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you? Protect her!`
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart! Load that gun!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Open the bolt!
Of course it is. Is it loaded?
That's a rifle you have?
What's this?
Mom?
Who was it?
You're free to go to her, if you want. If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change. I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up. Still miss your mother?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Leave a tip.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Make it fast.
The smallest thing I've got.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Mom?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do? Mom!
Yes sir. If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Tomorrow's Saturday. Anyway, she's dead.
She said you were legendary. I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Alive and hale. He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family. Is your mother often this unstable? Penelope!
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Yes, wife, it is. Come here, boy. Your father is home.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
He seems to think they are. He told me that were.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
You're supposed to get hurt!
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia. To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout. Play lots of contact sports?
It's rather a disappointment these days. It isn't there any more.
The name will live forever. It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia. Mhravitch.
Mhravitch. Remember that name.
We carried cyanide capsules. We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured. It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane. Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire. Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire. That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards. The face turns a curious shade of avocado. I must ask the doctor why that is. At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The story gets hairier. Should I stop?
Don't care for cold steel? A knife is worse than a bullet?
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
We blacked our hands and faces. At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village. The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Hid by day--fought by night. At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn. It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car. Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Behind a desk for a little while. A desk! They had him planning air raids. A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan. There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself. Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was a famous sniper. They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Oh hell.
"Dad?" Dad. The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Aha! He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
No.
It makes life spicy.
Excellent!
What a pity! Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch. Everything stops. And the doctor? He worships your father, too?
College?
College!
I see. And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Ah! And what sort of man is this worshiper?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Man and boy.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
The doctor was called away on an emergency. I think it was birth.
Dr. Woodly. I should make a little list.
Mind? God, yes, I mind. I'm your father's friend. A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Life has denied me that thrill.
Ask it!
You were about to ask a question?
Hello.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
As a matter of fact--
Do it, Norbert.
Norbert--you come, too. Let him go, Harold. Let him go.
You've killed women?
Out!
Then listen to me. You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride. I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl! You fool, you fool.
All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
How do I load?
Help your mother find the bullet.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do. It's the American way.
Ah! The lady is armed.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort. These elements are lacking.
Stop!
Don't!
You hope this, too?
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
No.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all. It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness. To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
But it's all balled up in your head with death. The highest honor is death. When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them. You honored them with death. Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
Honor, I suppose.
No you don't.
So he can kill you. You hate your own life that much. You beg for a hero to kill you.
That's really what you want. You become furious when people won't make you dead.
You're begging him to kill you?
He's a child!
Like what?
Sounds quite beautiful.
Blue soup?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
He's afraid of you, Harold. He knew you'd want to fight him. He doesn't know anything about fighting. He hates pain.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Rifle?
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I see.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Just one favor.
Almost a Christmas scene.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Hope.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit. He hasn't been home for two days. Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
It isn't a matter of liking. It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving? No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
He'd never seen a corpse. He's seen a dozen now.
If he wants to go.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now. Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
Sneaking in the back door.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD Goodbye.
No you're not!
What are you going to do?
I don't think so.
Yes.
His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.
Yes.
I learned a lot of things in college. Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And they have very mixed feelings about women. They hate them in a way. One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently. They can scrog them, as you say-- for revenge.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted. It's just the truth.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Well, I can. Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me. I'm not a silly carhop any more. Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would. But I've been sensitized. I have ideas now--and solid information. I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
I will not be scrogged. I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
This is not a coy deception. I do not want to be scrogged. I want love. I want tenderness.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
No.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile. The way to get your wife back is in bed. Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours. We're starving. Do you mind?
I should have torn that door off its hinges. Should have scrogged her ears off. Should have broken the bed. What do you want? Well?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People don't use that word any more.
You're a woman, aren't you?
Chow, chow, chow! God damn it-- nutriment!
You're wrong.
What a honeymoon.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple. Do you understand?
Ram it up your ass!
We all do. But now it's body time. Relax. Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods. Think of your muscles one by one. Let them go slack. Relax. Let the brain go blank. Relax. That's the idea-- that's my girl. Now the small of the back. Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body. That's why you're so tense! Forget Norbert. Relax. It's body time.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now. You mustn't scream. So tense, so tense.
Turn around?
I'm not going to strike you. I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie. You mustn't run away now. This is your loving husband approaching. I'm your husband. Society approves!
You used to like it stark!
Honeymoon! Honeymoon! Say it: Honeymoon!
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
A trip, you mean?
I did?
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Do say hello to your mother.
Awful. I can't tell you how sorry I am.
He doesn't deserve this! You don't know him. It isn't fair!
Please--
Harold!
I'm so glad you like each other. I was so scared, so scared.
Nothing would please me more.
I was, I was. It never lasts long.
When I'm dead-- or fucking.
We all are.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Your old beau?
What's that all about?
Bluh.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Disease?
What sort of time period do you have in mind? Half an hour? An hour?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Like hugging a lamp post.
What's the matter?
Not at all.
How do you do?
Some kind of animal?
What do you do for a living?
This is crazy.
You don't even know me.
I'm engaged.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married. My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Yes, sir. It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be. And what to drink?
Sir?
Eighteen-- and a half.
Can I help you, sir?
"Hamburger Heaven."
How do you do. My name is Penelope Ryan. This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Leave the rifle here.
What are you going to do?
New lives begin!
Thank you--for my life.
Can't do it.
No.
No. No.
Don't shoot.
What is this thing that kills me?
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it. It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
I'm going to shoot you now.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You're making a mistake. Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded. You've wounded me.
Here. Finish the job.
Was I ever of use?
You're too modest.
The new hero is you.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Don Quixote.
I see.
You can never take yourself seriously again! Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back. That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I put a poisoned thought in your head. Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind. It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
With spittle?
Cut me open. Find out.
No quarter asked. No quarter given.
You hope.
I'm an honorable clown?
This is going to become very physical. Are you prepared for that?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
I love you! Have a cigar!
Glands. You're supposed to be happy when you die. Call me comical again.
You're in one hell of a jam. You realize that?
Hands and knees, you say?
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
You're a son of a bitch.
A living fossil! Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're old--so old.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice? Will I bleed from my every orifice? Who will clean up this awful mess?
What an hallucination! Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. Oh dearie me.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers. But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth! Correct?
There's going to be no bloodshed here. I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth. Am I correct?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
It's healer to killer. Is that the same thing?
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Quarantine, possibly. You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without. Goodbye.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
I thought she was a widow.
Good Lord.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people. Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
Hundreds.
Congratulations. By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Pacqualinincheewa root. Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
You have chills?
You've been bitten by bats?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today? A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Ah! You're ambulatory!
Whose son this is, whose wife that is. A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time. Good night.
What next? You leave promptly, of course. There is no question as to whose home this is--
She's crying because she's so happy.
Tough luck. You'll have to split the fee.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Safe and sound, I see. Oh--you came back.
I've literally got to run!
I've got to run!
And her fiancé!
Yes! Please! You've got to get out right now!
Neighbor! Doctor! I live across the hall.
Yes! Yes! The boy! One boy!
Will you please go? An emergency!
She's fine. Please--
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go. I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here. You can come back later.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment. You seemed at home here.
We'll miss you so.
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital. Tell the hospital to expect her. I'll leave right now.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Hello? Oh--hello, Mother.
He's dead, you know.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
It's always locked.
You startled me.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Ooops.
What will you do, Colonel?
I dunno.
Yeah--cripes. I never did get any sense out of Alice. She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel. It was a bitch. You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy. Maybe not. I dunno, boy. That's civilian life for you. Who knows what kills anybody?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive. Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered. She had her Goddamn knitting. I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
My mother-in-law. Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
No, no--shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.
Jesus.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
There was so much going on.
She did?
I dunno. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I did.
Thank you. You can leave now. We'll begin.
You don't know?
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget. He drove me to drink. He drove his first two wives to drink.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife. He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Never mind. It's a dumb theory. I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol. Peace.
Is it? I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
+++$+++ Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation. Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring. He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace. He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes. He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet. That was very important to him. I did it. I tried to be a good wife. He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo. I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did. It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids. Any little kids.
+++$+++ Because he was cruel?
+++$+++ You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club? Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
+++$+++ You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
+++$+++ Aha! Hello! You're Mildred, right?
No.
Don't touch me.
I'll kill myself.
I don't want to live any more.
What a relief!
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act. Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing. Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Explain it to them. I'm bugging out of here.
Don't!
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time. It drives me nuts!
She doesn't care! She's not married any more! She's going to have fun! I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it. Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
It's my father's birthday--that's all. That's all. Who cares about that?
Don't worry about it.
I don't care what she wears.
Okay.
Yeah.
Really?
What does he say to do?
What are his symptoms?
That's why I'm crying.
I don't get it.
What?
Mom?
Don't know.
Father's friend.
No.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What difference does that make? Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Where will you be?
I hate that thing.
I don't really know.
A lot of people don't.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose. As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
You know she has no feet! You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Not true.
That's an interesting piece of news.
A what kind of doctor?
Thank you, kind sir.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
He's a ghost!
Oh, Paul--
I know.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
And this is my son, Paul. He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
He is my father.
He isn't any friend of Father.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
Keeps fairies away!
It's jungle rot! This room is making everybody sick! This is your family doctor speaking now. Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I apologize. But you didn't know him, and neither did I. How's your asthma?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Oh?
You're going out?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
You and Harold are friends?
It's true.
You were wonderful.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Thank you, Herb. You're a wonderful man. You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
I'm sorry.
A week. We were waiting for the right time to--
Possibly.
What's the matter now?
What was it?
We've got to find him. I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. That's all he said--the thing about the key?
Did you talk to Paul?
How nice.
A what?
You figure!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
He ditched me. He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Far as I know.
Yeah.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him. We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one. Shall we go?
Gentlemen! Is this right for a fight? It's been so long.
Coming.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly. Good night.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong. I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
Something happens to my confidence.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh. If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
All through the day I'm so confident. That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know? I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence. People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman. They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year. I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence. That's what charges them up.
He'd assume we had.
He'd kill me. He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Goodbye.
You fake! You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon. You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
It's really that bad?
Thanks.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now. She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
We met here earlier this evening.
He'd go to a movie. I think that's what he'd do. If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying. We could have him paged.
It's a jungle out there.
He's not your son.
We've got to rescue him.
Paul's only twelve years old.
And maybe Paul. What about the murderers? They're in there!
I'm amazed.
Why would you do that?
Meaning?
It's suicide!
No! Oh no! Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old. Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
It's an experimental model. He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
That's the XKE.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
As long as he keeps out of the park.
It is?
Tonight's the night.
Wear a coat of domestic mink. For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
Oh no! Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun. I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Take plenty of cigars.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks. I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat. I'm going to bring that boy back.
I feel like I've been double- crossed. If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around. I'm going to go get him--
Kid--kid--
You think you're so funny. You're not even funny. Right? Right? You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device. Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Phooey.
Or get eaten alive.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Is that a fact?
Hi kid. Would you look what the car dragged in.
+++$+++ We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
+++$+++ Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard. Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
+++$+++ Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
+++$+++ Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
+++$+++ We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
+++$+++ We have this new club up here in Heaven.
No. I don't think so.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No.
+++$+++ Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
+++$+++ What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
+++$+++ You mean I'm black?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
That's cool.
Now, what do you want?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Are you going to stiff me?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Pull out your cock.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
You're not Vice, are you? Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
You're still dressed?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you want to take a session?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
THE WINDOW +++$+++ 'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.
THE WINDOW +++$+++ 'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Just one.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
That's all you got, three girls?
What girls you got here?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah.
Yeah. How did you know?
If you say so.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yeah.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Is this all the display space we can get?
But then you'll forget about me.
I can't tell you that.
What happened?
Did you find out where she was?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Granville?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex... ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
You wife isn't dead is she?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Grand Rapids? Of course.
They are the same.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
Where does he live.
Why can't I meet him now?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
I thought I was fucked up.
You really believe all that?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
No, please go on.
Fuck.
Shit.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
What the crap?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
He deals in pain.
Tod was. He was with Ratan.
Tijuana.
I care about my daughter.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
Not very.
But it's all you do.
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No. But does it make any difference? How did you get to be the way you are?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You don't understand shit.
'Sucking off.'
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you?
What rate?
At least I'm a growing person.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
And your wife? Where's she?
Jesus.
Of Joanne's?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
You don't drink?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
Huh?
I am.
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
When do we start?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Up front?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Are you a private detective?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Tod might know.
Do you know where she would be?
Do you know where she lives?
You know her?
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
You making a feature?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
It's your money. You talk.
No.
Are you Niki?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
The other girl is the star?
Are you the star of this picture?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Just leave me alone.
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed... One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country. How'd you hear about him?
Where'd you hear that name?
Like what?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Get out!
Get out.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy. A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Yeah. Probably.
The police? They know less than you do.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
I don't know.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
I don't know.
There's a little stall theatre up here. It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
They're legal now.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
I don't know.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
What are you paying me for?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
Yeah.
Mr. Van Dorn?
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here. Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
You are.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
...What do you have to offer?
So then, Mr. Mast...
Well, what do they know?
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What?
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here. What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
Jake?
Pretty good.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
Is Marsha there?
What happened?
What is it, Jake?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
+++$+++ Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
+++$+++ I don't know.
+++$+++ She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
+++$+++ Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
+++$+++ God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
+++$+++ Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
+++$+++ Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
+++$+++ Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
+++$+++ I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
+++$+++ Hey man.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Where's Ratan?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Good.
Okay.
Well...
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Rucker.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
I want to meet Ratan.
No.
Yeah.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
But I...
I'm just trying to find... Who owns this store?
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman... ...right here.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
It's a short film.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
What?
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business? Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
In other words, you want to get laid?
What exactly do you have in mind?
Oh. Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Film making can be pretty expensive...
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
What do you think of that? Or this?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
What does that do?
Com'on, tell me.
What's that?
I don't know.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
To his own daughter?
Huh?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I've been on another case. All day. I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing. I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
Jake'll take care of me.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You can fuck off, too.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Thanks.
Was he with a girl?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
+++$+++ I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
+++$+++ Eh, Poli Sci?
+++$+++ And what are you studying?
+++$+++ You are at the University, Candy?
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
Because if you are...
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Check.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Officer, I can explain.
No.
We planted it.
But there is a family resemblance.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Haven't we met before?
Okay, lady. Out.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Your tree.
Took it?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Could I see your registration?
How long have you been driving?
Come again.
Yes.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
+++$+++ She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
+++$+++ Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
+++$+++ Edith was just telling me about her job.
+++$+++ Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
+++$+++ How interesting.
+++$+++ And what do you do, my dear?
+++$+++ Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
What kind of a car is it?
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one. Tell me, what do you see?
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
"And this too shall pass away."
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
I feel giddy.
But why now?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
For you.
It's all right. It's organic.
Supper for two.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
It looks like you. Thanks.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
I took them out.
Here.
Maude.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world. What a joke it will be if like them I -
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Yes. They're old friends.
Well, they're my species.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Oh, you weren't scared.
That wasn't very scary.
Give me that. I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company. That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking? Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
But they'll put me in jail.
But they have.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Maude, I must speak to you.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Where's that?
Yodeling?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I'd feel stupid.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
With God?
Maude, do you pray?
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Look at that sky. It's so big.
I like you, Maude.
Okay.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Yes. I haven't lived. I've died a few times.
You are the wisest person I know.
Did Confucius say that?
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I like Glaucus.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
The ice is melting.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I don't know.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Superb.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Well, I don't...
No more revolts.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier. Later, Frederick would chide me about it. He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
My umbrella? Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition. A long time ago.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, I really don't drink...
Yes.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
We'll come back in the morning.
Is he all right?
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
But this is public property.
But we can't just dig it up!
But what?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Over there by the courthouse.
Look.
Well...
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals. Of course, the age has its advantages.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Why do you say that?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
That's a nice teapot.
You don't look eighty.
You look as if you could.
Certainly a new experience for me.
No, you have to touch it. You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
What do you think?
It goes on and on.
Now I'll pump it up... ... and you just turn the handles. Okay. What do you smell?
Yes. Very much.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form. Do you disapprove?
She seemed yare to me.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
How about some ginger pie?
Harold?
All right.
All right.
Sort of.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
No.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Oh, look! The birds.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Oh.
Your hearse?
Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end - - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
No. I thought not.
Do you sing and dance?
Do you dance?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
I don't know.
Eh, no.
Eh, no. Thank you.
+++$+++ This is insane.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
I don't care what people say.
At a funeral.
+++$+++ A sunflower?
+++$+++ I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
+++$+++ To whom?
+++$+++ Fay, I'll call you back. What did you say?
+++$+++ Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
+++$+++ Not now, Harold... You can't put me down for Monday?
+++$+++ Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
+++$+++ Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Like a tea ceremony?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
Oh, is this your father?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Can't complain.
What kind of stuff?
What would you say?
Why?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No.
Well, maybe one.
No.
Huh?
I go to funerals.
What else do you like?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
No.
And a lot of time.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Yes. It does.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
A rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
She took my head.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Parasite!
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
+++$+++ Harold!
+++$+++ Souvenirs?
+++$+++ Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
+++$+++ Well, I don't...
+++$+++ Eh?
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ Oh sure.
+++$+++ Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
ZAT!
Another man's life in your sights.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
To pit your own life against another.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
You think so, sir?
Jeez! That's a great story,
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
War is not all black.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
+++$+++ Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
+++$+++ Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
+++$+++ Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
But wait...
Well, I didn't.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Yes.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
+++$+++ No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
We have no more surprises.
It's different for us.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
I knew you'd come.
Julia.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Yes!
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
It certainly is.
She certainly has.
I know.
No. You look...
Yes... Yes. You look...
Kyle, you don't have...
Because I'm going to get my father!
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Get out of the way.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
What do you mean?
What?
The box. I need the box.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
And you're sure it was a woman?
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
No bad dreams.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
What?
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Well... G'bye.
I'm scared.
I've got to finish it.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I... remember.
Nonsense, I...
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Wait!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Then why are you here?
The Cenobites.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
Yeah.
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Oh, excuse me...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Steve...
Where am I?
They were over here, Professor.
Is he serious??
See what??
Oh, right --
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
You were burned by some organic acid.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed. Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
You mean, outside... with her.
Story of my life.
+++$+++ It doesn't say --
+++$+++ harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
See? I don't like that --
+++$+++ Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
From where??!!
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
In private, if you don't mind...
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
What the hell was that? An ape?
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
No. It's not.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
He's just going through a phase --
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
I thought you liked being on TV.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Is it bad?
Oh, stop that -- Damn! Be careful, there --
Me?? C'mon --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the ones who bump back.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
We're on the move.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Well, you did break out --
I don't want him.
Got tired of me?
Who's the squirt?
Sir, may I go first??
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Who?!
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads." And crossroads I have become. Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
She's dead.
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world. I alone know your true calling, your true name.
My job.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
You call that thing a cigar??
I'm in charge. We go back!
-- should go back. Now!
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Each of us gets a belt.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. You know monsters.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
But not everyone was so lucky. Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
Alone?
On a scale of one to ten: two. But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Good night.
Not from you.
Not hungry.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Shh! Just a second.
Hostage negotiations.
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Hey. You: think twice --
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
You want me to hold him down?
No. I never was.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Goodbye.
Myers?
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Myers??? How's your arm?
Helping you -- I just --
Whatcha looking at, John??
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
You're kidding --
Marco...
Good.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this -- But I can't. I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Hi.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
You're going alone?
Out? Out out?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Goodnight, then.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me -- Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
You better have that looked at.
Hit me.
That you feel that way about me.
But it's not true, is it?
It's freezing, isn't it?
What about you?
He -- loves you.
A brute.
Cocky.
He's just pushy.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
+++$+++ Two steps back, please.
+++$+++ -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
+++$+++ -- Late. Five minutes late.
+++$+++ Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
My fucking hand!
Christ!
Just take it slowly.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
+++$+++ Will you sign for the bed?
+++$+++ We're leaving.
Not much.
Hi.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Julia's my second wife.
Her mother's dead.
Uh-huh.
+++$+++ Do you really need this bed, lady?
It'll go in.
You can keep them.
Stay the fuck away from me.
No. That wasn't the deal.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
HE did. I've seen him.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
You did this before, right?
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
No!
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
Who are you?
It's just a puzzle box.
We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Please listen to me --
It's important.
I have to speak to my father.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Poor baby.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Some things have to be endured...
Come to Daddy.
One last time. Give me the box.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
No.
No.
Kirsty?
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
So where's the harm?
You can't love him.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
So you were cheated.
You're still afraid.
Who did?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Hell...
What kind of doors?
Let me see.
A box?
You promised me an explanation.
Tell me, damn you.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Later.
Well?
You're hurting.
Keep your voice down.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Good.
Hurting.
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
...somebody...
Back from where?
What happened to you?
No. God no.
Tell me who you are.
I said: don't look.
Don't look at me.
Julia.
I'm very happy.
Forget him.
I don't want to see the dress.
I don't want to see the dress.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Oh. Oh yes.
I came for the wedding.
I'm brother Frank.
You're Julia, right?
No, damn you --
I saw everything.
I was here this afternoon.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
What's the problem?
Kirsty? It's very late.
Sure.
What happened?
Which is where?
Hi. I got soaked.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
It's better you see for yourself --
I don't know where to begin...
Please. I can't bear it...
Please...
Come with me then.
Oh baby.
Larry...
-- I'll go see.
Fine.
I've seen worse.
Kirsty.
O.K.
O.K.
Sure.
Can I get you anything?
Oh, babe...
Are you all right?
I'm here.
Are you O.K.?
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
I'll be scarred for life.
So damn stupid.
No, you're not.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Shit.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I cut myself.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
We'll move in Sunday.
Well?
He's here?
Where are you?
Larry!
No argument.
All right.
No. I'm not.
You mean we're moving in?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
The best part of ten years.
It's just been empty a while.
Ah!
Like who?
O.K. O.K.
It's ONE of these.
What's wrong?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Why don't you do the same?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
First time for everything.
I suppose not.
What's going on?
This isn't the bedroom.
No personal details?
No, not much.
Is this your place ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
I... suppose so, yes.
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
I suppose that's right.
You know it's not often I... you know...
That depends.
Please.
Just soda.
I wonder, maybe...
Drinking alone.
Not much fun, is it?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
You wouldn't believe me.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I won't be a moment.
Wait a moment --
What happened to me?
I have to get out.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Get the fuck out of here.
Yes!
I want to see.
I don't believe it.
Gone?
Finished?
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Of course.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
What?
Really?
You don't like her at all do you?
I guess.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I love you, honey.
Never better. You sleep well.
Steve?
What are you drinking, love?
Are you O.K.?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Surprise.
Is Julia here?
Me like.
Big house.
Call me tomorrow.
O.K.
You will keep in touch.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Well come over, will you? See the place?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Do you want me to come over?
You'd like the house.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
What did you say?
Where are you?
Kirsty?
Who's there?
'Bye.
I'll come back later, huh?
What did I say?
What?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What things?
What happened to you?
It's a fetish of mine.
Can I lend you a hand?
Are you busy after work ?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Your father told me you were working here.
Are you alright ?
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Oh no.
We're not all frigid.
I beg your pardon?
Meaning what?
I see.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
What do we do if there isn't?
All right. No. That's nice.
Not that late.
You know I do know the way home.
I thought we'd lost you.
I AM house-trained.
Just upstairs.
So lie down.
That's right. Cointreau.
Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me.
Really? Married Kevin? Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that? None, no chance. That's just fate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Rob. Rob Gordon. Circa junior high...
+++$+++ Really.
+++$+++ I don't know.
That's what we want. Reaction. And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em. Let 'em riot, we can handle it. We'll be ready.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that. Over the edge, in fact.
What do you think? Dick likes it.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by. They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing. We're called SDM. Sonic Death Monkey.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
No. We need the gig.
We're getting that anyway.
Laura said we could. If we helped out with the posters and stuff. And we did. And we are.
HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector?
I heard you, man. Don't give me that "what" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
What the fuck is that?
No way.
Not really.
Liar. We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Fuck off, Barry.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Laura. Her dad died.
Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window.
Of course I'm not coming. Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave? Where is it? The fucking Bucktown Pub? Ha!
None. Christ!
Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Isn't it?
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea.
I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments.
Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
My band.
Hey.
Suck my ass.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? You two have to stick together now. Boners United. United in getting some.
Oh come on, Rob. What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name?
Un-fucking-believable. Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Fine by me. I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Why would they care?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar. You saw it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick. We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet. Yet. What does "yet" mean, anyway? "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean? It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Okay. Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What do you mean, "what?"
It's not my car, now is it? It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow. Fucking great.
That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry!
I didn't know it was classified information. I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
I wanna date a musician...
Yeah.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
What did he ever do to you?
Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Not the point.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Nice, Barry.
We'll do it next Monday.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Say it.
What's next?
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon. You should get out of bed earlier.
I don't want old sad bastard music either. I just want something I can ignore.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
NO--!
That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television?
Well what about the new Echo --
They always seemed...
I have all of the others.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not. Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
No, you can't.
Oh yeah. We got it.
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Don't do it, Rob!
Anna Moss.
Anna.
Who are you going to see?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
We work there!
On Clark Street!
You can be and are wrong.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Bullshit.
No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
What?
No. The Righteous Brothers.
It's the new --
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. That's all.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment?
Oh, hi.
No. No. Mom wants you to come to the funeral. It's on Friday.
Haha. Right. It's no problem. I love making tapes.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there. Instead of "Sin City."
Who? Oh. My friend. My friend is Laura. A girl. A friend who's a girl.
Yeah.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. So... I should really put a James Brown in there --
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Is that it?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone. A bit controversial, I know, but...
Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so?
What do you mean, four more?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club. It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Pardon me?
Yeah. I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
So. Is now a good time?
Huh. You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in. You must have only been about sixteen.
Oh. Okay.
Right. Why?
Uh. That's me.
May I help you?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like. What the hell?
Huh?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Hey Charlie.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you?
Yeah, sure...
Who's that?
What is this.
Can I do anything?
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole.
Well we rang $900 today.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Rob --!
Liz, hold on a second -- What?
I want a tape.
Yeah.
Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that. And he likes you. It's just that --
Fine.
'Course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. I'll tell him next time I see him.
Are you all right?
Hey. Didn't you steal that one already?
What's this?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc. The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. You didn't see the cover though.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, OK. I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl. The one on Testament of Youth. Never released here. Japanese import only.
Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.
Nothing to resolve, Ian. Let's get a drink.
Mmmm, no. Not a good idea.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm off the phone.
Laura? Are you okay?
I dunno.
We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
Think about it, Rob.
Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
We've noticed and we're glad. But, you know... how are we going to make peace here? We want to make things easier for you. What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment. I'd hate it if I lost her. But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision. Do you see what I'm saying?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob. We're talking actionable harassment. Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Hello, Rob. Remember me? I'm Ray. Ian.
It's gonna be fine. These people are ready for anything.
Well, you've asked.
I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I've changed my mind. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do. I will.
About what?
So?
No. I don't think so. I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Very persuasive.
Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
No. Probably not.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
I know.
Ha ha ha. Hoo hoo hoo.
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm going to talk to you.
Not really.
I know. I don't get it.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk. I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
It's no joke. I'm responsible for what happens, you know. Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards. I have to put down a deposit for the room. I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Yeah. His band is playing a set.
Barry said its done.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore. It might even be why I came back.
Just local, of course.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record. Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
You did that deliberately. You knew all along I'd like them. It was a trick.
I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
At Paul and Miranda's. Paul from work.
Wanna go to dinner?
Hi. What are you doing?
No use.
How? What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Yeah, you're alright. But you're certainly not happy. So what happens if you get happy? And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable? What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Less neurotic. Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
More confident, maybe.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink. And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you. If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
But what?
Because I'm not allowed to. I still do, after work. So, what? Should we just break up? Is that what you're saying? Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
How? How were we the same people?
Money does not matter. I do not care how much you earn. I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
I'll pay for you. Even though you owe me money. We have to do something with the money I earn. I need to. I deserve it. You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
... Like Mexico. Or Jamaica. Or New York, even.
Look, Rob. If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
To make you feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Okay, that's cool, okay. But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
You know the difference.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What it was like.
C'mon. I want to know.
Let's go home. Okay?
Mission accomplished.
What about Ian?
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split. But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Laura...
Look, we can do other things.
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Hello. It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.
What?
When are you going back?
What do you want to do?
Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What do you mean?
I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Mmnn.
Uh... No.
Sure. I'll see you on Friday.
Yes, of course.
I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
My dad liked you. And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know. I don't really understand it. I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on. It's like... He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
In a minute. When I get it together.
I'm sorry.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better.
Are you alright?
I can't talk right now.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Well, think about it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I'm sorry to go on about it. But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you. I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand? That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me. I like Sting and you hate him. But the rest of this stuff... Who the hell is Nick Lowe? Or Gram Parsons? Or the Boredoms? I don't know these people. I...
Those aren't mine.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Mmm hmm.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh. It's everything else I don't know about.
I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place.
You know what I mean.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'm sure.
He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
I called and called but you were out. I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
You don't ever think about other people?
I'm not experimenting. Why don't you go experiment.
Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.
I'm not -- hold on...
I figured it was. Where are you?
Hello.
Call me at work. We can arrange to meet properly. I don't want this to be the last conversation we have. I know what you're like.
Will you call me?
We can meet for another drink if you want. So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it? The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob... Are you there? What are you thinking?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana? Maybe a Liz Phair track. There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff. The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you... But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. Ah. Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan. Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings. He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I told you I slept with him.
So, how are you?
We'll talk some other time.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Hi. I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me. Have you seen them around?
Will you please just go?
No. I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love. Not yet. But I'll tell you one thing. The sleeping together is better.
I haven't felt like it.
Well the answer is that I don't know either. We haven't done it yet.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you?
Is what better? Better than what?
Just ask it!
Nevermind.
Fine. One.
I'm too tired for this now. I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up? I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Oh, Rob, shut up.
I suppose so.
I don't know.
Look. Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me. Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know. All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I am not living with him. I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. You know that, don't you? I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run. Probably nothing.
Rob. Don't be childish.
Did you say something?
What?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
What's the obvious stuff?
What were the others?
What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I'm sorry. I haven't been very fair to you. That's why I came here to the store this evening. I feel terrible, Rob. This is really hard, you know.
I think you know that.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Not really.
Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
But don't you remember?
Hey! Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
-- Alright, alright but --
-- Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Hi.
I should be so lucky.
Well stay for tonight, then.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered. Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo. But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Enough, Liz.
No. They don't know him. And Ken liked you. Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know. It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
What difference does it make?
It's a crematorium.
Well she --
It's true!
-- No, no, no, don't even. I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Yeah. Like I said, I don't want to take sides. And I like Laura with you. She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together. I just wish you two could, I don't know. I don't think much of this Ian guy --
How're you holding up?
You called this morning?
Hey. It's Liz.
Right.
And so it is. I'll talk to you later.
That way. You?
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Good.
So you'll stay?
Jesus, so much for delicacy. I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
I'd better go. I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Whiskey.
I'm sure it isn't.
Yes. You?
Nor have you!
Exactly! Fucking ex-actly!
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Yeah, I know the Crumblers! I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it. My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
I understand completely.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
It's a great song.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually.
Hi, Marie.
Don't you like that?
So you live in Chicago now?
Good. 'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
Mom! For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married! She is not that kind of girl! To use a phrase. That's not what happens now.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
She just called. She doesn't even know. It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice. That's weird, isn't it? You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out.
She left. She's gone.
So so. Up and down.
Great. Super-fantastic.
Hi, Mom.
Yeah?
Oh, come on! Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Seventy-five.
Sixty.
Suit yourself. There are plenty of others who will.
That wasn't part of the deal. I want to be poisonous but fair.
Years. This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old. A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me. Can you make sure you give me a five? I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
I must have nothing. Their my husband's.
I know what they're worth. Give me fifty and get them out.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
What do you think?
Nice.
Whatever.
We're not there yet, Justin.
It's rough. But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio. I'll take care of the rest. I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Records are those big round black things, right?
No, we...
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
I think you have more.
Naw. Those are for us.
Go to hell.
Sure.
Uncle Joey's little girl. Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
He'd want to know about all this.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral. The father looked just like Richard. Even had a mark on his cheek.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill. I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank. So he isn't a cop. District anyway.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967. And the guys rich. You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
You're the expert.
Huh?
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
How's your uncle? I hardly ever see him anymore.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Happy birthday.
You're very macabre.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Would you remember his name?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
The boy _died_?
I don't follow you.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Why?
No thank you, I'm fine.
+++$+++ Anything in Maryland is close.
+++$+++ Taupin, Richard Marshall. Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland. Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
+++$+++ -Okay okay.
+++$+++ This is against the rules.
It will be horrible. The future. I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing. Nothing but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
You have lived forever.
Not power. Not control.
The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
No!
I'm the last. Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
I can't stand it. Oh God, I can't stand it!
Be careful. Don't stay any longer than you have to.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most. You should be back by nightfall.
What is it you want?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it like? Being you?
Come here, Brenna.
Is that a threat?
You kill with your left hand?
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you? Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
What about that family in '31?
You killed those other two.
Of bodies.
That's insane.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
He knows about you.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
I'd like you to try.
Who are you?
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
I see.
Why are you here?
You won't.
A factor of age.
That's impossible.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
You're using your son's name.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I don't know any of these. I'll make a fool of myself.
It's beautiful.
There's a catch. You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Yes.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
I wish I could.
There was a man once. Just a simple woodcarver. But he understood. More than anyone he could see to the heart of it. It never ends. Today is the same as the first. Tomorrow will be the same as today. So much time. And all of it wasted. You love history?
You want me to front for you.
You make it all sound so simple.
When you finish, what then?
You did kill those men.
What's all that?
Our cars were seen together in Felton. They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Is this what you killed them with?
You're a fool.
You had to do _nothing_!
No one knows you're here?
Are you?
Go home.
You are being foolish.
Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
Have you gone to the police?
You?
He's dead. Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
That bothers you?
Not your concern.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
And you?
Who is he?
Where?
What the hell is going on?
Why not?
Jesus Christ.
I have friends.
I've been to Church Hill.
I think you do. Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
Does Carl Smith?
Who?
Grave robbers?
Someone beat you.
Good reflexes.
Charming guy, Basil. Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Byzantine?
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Very traditional.
Do you play?
Thanks.
+++$+++ Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
+++$+++ Aren't you getting a little old for this? You flunked out of law school.
I'm just curious.
Don't be stupid, lady. Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
What were you doing in Felton?
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house. There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet. I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I want Taupin.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try. What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew. In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But there's more. Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware. Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
All fashionably without heads.
What are you going to tell them? That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
You and I should talk first.
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town. And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies. That's my right.
A murder.
Who is it?
It's bullshit. Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Some job. Card filing and cabinet dusting. Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Yeah.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
You talked to your supervisor lately? He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight. That on top of the cops bugging him.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You see that desk? _Your_ desk? You see the crap piled up on it?
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved. It's just a hunk of peasant iron. Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it.
I don't believe him.

Go ahead, Senor. I have my friend to keep me company.
That is not me.
Of course.
I am not ready for this.
And you?
But why be so concerned about me?
I feel hardly nothing.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
All living things pay dues, Conor. They must be respected for that.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
It's like to kill me first.
Muy Bien!
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
Harder! You swing like an impotent cow!
Me arm hurts.
We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of sorts.
Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help.
There is an imperfection. For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat. Then it is over. The end.
It is always less with my living. Far or near. But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before. There is power in this. And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Oh my God. Oh my God I'm lost.
Then they were right. I am evil. This is God's punishment.
What is to become of me? Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
This is monstrous. I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
This can't be.
No!
This is madness!
No!
We are immortal.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
I'm twenty-two.
I don't understand.
He told me there could be only one.
I don't know why.
It is less.
Yes. Always.
You are the same?
It was time for our paths to cross.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
You Scots have a way with game. It still has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so...domestic.
Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this?
How can you know this?
I was driven out.
Aye.
I did at that.
I was nearly killed.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
Please go to no trouble.
I am from Spain. And I would like a moment of your time.
Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your name is Conor?
Do what you must.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
I'll not take that kind of talk from you. From those others below, maybe. But not from you.
Me father has taken back my hand.
I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Some think not.
Live? In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
You cannot be real, Conor. You had the last rites. No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
I have no future husband.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
Kiss me.
That's wonderful. Where did you ever learn it?
Something pretty.
Oh please. Another one.
Our common heritage. I am your only real friend, you know. The only one who truly understands you. I look forward to the day we meet again. And I kill you.
Finish your prayers?
Romirez understood. Not you.
You're wrong.
No doubt.
Not so scared.
Tradition.
Certainly not me.
Not likely.
Won't get it. We are a sacrifice. A diversion.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Complete your inspection?
You see Major? You are not so different...
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Who do you think I am? One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow? "Threaten you"? You and I just living will always be a threat. Forever. Look at your life, Major. Look at mine. Nothing there but threat. Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Stay out of it.
It never changes, Major.
Help? I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
We have no understanding.
If you wish to play games, Major.
Excuse me, "sir". I thought we spoke as equals.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Second musketeer.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Mulet.
He's a MacLeod.
Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Your father must be smart.
Where did you learn that?
Thanks.
No. I want this to be all ours.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Are you sure?
Should have seen him the first night. Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Yeah.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
_Answer_ me.
He knows I'm here. How?
And the Bulgarian?
How many came?
What name is he using?
Where!
You're wrong.
I've had a few more concerns.
How do you do it, Kahn? How do you live so full of life for so long?
You're insane.
You were never a kid.
-Since you last saw me.
He always did.
Good times then. A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears. Not like now.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
And have you something to settle with me?
What are you doing here?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Head still secure to the neck.
Sit.
Kahn?
Get up.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
It's all we have.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
This isn't done. Get up.
As you wish.
You disappoint me. I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Run!
Of sorts.
My quarry grows clever with age. And the others, incompetent.
Not so long.
Should I care?
+++$+++ Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
+++$+++ I want you to come to me.
+++$+++ We have some unfinished business.
All I need is time.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Where were you Tuesday night?
For the moment.
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A claymore to be exact. You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Do you know what this is?
That's none of your business.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way. He'd also been in the country less than a week. What is your citizenship?
It doesn't.
No.
I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after.
Yes.
They were Steven, they were. It's been a miracle it has. He lasted right through and healed. No one in the village has ever seen anything like it. Ever.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
Nothing to be sorry about.
+++$+++ Yes sir. When you get older your priorities change. It's the simple things that count. Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
+++$+++ Such a pretty day. If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this. Mind you I'm 74 now.
+++$+++ Morning Mr. North
When may I expect the cleaners?
We were very close.
His only kid.
+++$+++ Oh yes, more than enough.
+++$+++ When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Open this door!
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Who is it?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Hildy!
Bon jour!
I'll keep you in mind.
I got my rhyming dictionary in --
Sort of a Jack London style?
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Of course! Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff. How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. Mervyn, isn't it?
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
The poem?... The poem was great!
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Excuse me, I just want to --
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ? Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Did you give her the money?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Where'd she go?
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. Walter!
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Hildy!
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
The Criminal Courts Building.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, wasn't it?
The check, Bruce!
What's the matter?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
But --
The five hundred? Sure.
All right, dear.
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
He certainly -- hic -- does!
No. It's strong. But I like it that way.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Gee! Take a look, will you?
The money? Why?
That's the kind of stuff they want!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
Hildy!
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, she'll know some day.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, I'm independent, too.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
How?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
I see what you mean.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Yes, I know... Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
Mother? But your mother --
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down! After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Oh.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.

Then who are you?
You're Bruce Baldwin?
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Get out of here, you!
Give me the District Attorney's office. I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary. Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Do you want to get us scooped?
Call Duffy!
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. And you'll be an accessory!
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
You'll ask me to what?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
It'll be Heaven!
Hildy, darling!
Walter, you can't do that!
You're not fooling anybody.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
What!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What's the matter with my brains?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Walter!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
In a way.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Who did you talk to?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Wait a minute! Let go there!
No!
No, you don't! Walter!
Don't open that!
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Will you come here?
Come here. See if we can move it.
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it. Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy? Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease. Louie.
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here! Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello? I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em! Duffy! Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation! Duffy!!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Oh, for -- H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Hello -- hello...
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Look at me, Hildy --
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Where is she? Tell me!
What happened?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
I'm finished.
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Railroad tickets.
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right. Duffy's getting old!
Hildy!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
All the words you've got.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Hildy!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
I get it!
I'd like to think.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I know, but --
Oh, get off that trapeze! There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
I know. Where is he, I said.
Yes. Where is he?
Hold on a minute.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train. And no tricks, Walter!
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
You said it.
What now?
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What for?
No kidding?
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Then what does he want with you?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
You're not afraid, are you?
Say, could I meet him?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
The insurance business?
What's his line?
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Where'd you meet this man?
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Look at this!
I'm not working for any other paper!
Please! Will you just --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Get away, Svengali.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Keep away --
No!
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Sweeney? Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Dead?
What's the matter?
You -- you --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Listen, Walter --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I know, Walter, but I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Just what I said. That's what I --
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
No, I can't.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
What?!!
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
What home?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Done what?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed. "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
How long is what?
Hello, Hildy!
What do you want?
You grey-haired old Judas!
+++$+++ I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
+++$+++ You know you did!
+++$+++ What's that -- what's that?
I always have both.
Sure, boss.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Who do you want?
Anything you want, Boss.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Here's that certified check, Walter. I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Walter!
Let's see the money.
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
A lot of money. Four hundred and fifty dollars --
There's money in it, Cooley.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
I think it is.
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
I don't know --
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Me, too.
You said it!
Point the gun at me!
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
All right -- all right!
Just a second, Mike --- Mollie, I got it!
Beats king up.
I call. What you got?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Well, that about covers everything.
Hold the phone!
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Who engineered this getaway?
So have we!
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
What have you got, Hildy?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Now, where is he?
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
So long, Hildy.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Good coffee, isn't it?
That's all right.
Just coffee. And you, sir?
I guess so.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
How's everything, Gus?
That's murder!
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
With a bag of marshmallows.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Hold her, boys!
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Same way you did. Through that gate.
Where is he?
After all I've done for you --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
What went off?
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Just one second --
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
For who?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
And so do I!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
That's a lie!!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Who is this man?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into. But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Hello, Olsen... Listen... Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there. Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
What?
Just -- one -- second!
Now what do you say?
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Cover up that transmitter!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
What is it?
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Pure politics!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Fred!
What do you mean -- through?
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Go on -- shoot me!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Five hundred dollars.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
I can't.
Now, Hildy --
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
All right, Judge.
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Where's the old lady?
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
There goes another scrub lady.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
I'll take it. What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
This is Hildy Johnson... Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats. Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies. Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Look out, you --
Okay. Forget it.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
And up a dime.
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
First you got to sign a receipt.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Mother!
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Any dope yet on how he got out?
That's good.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Mother!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Mother!
What good'll it do?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Well, maybe you think I could!
Earl, you must never do that again.
I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Don't move!
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Put down that gun, Earl.
I won't, Earl.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
A gun? Why -- to shoot, of course.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
Are you all right, now?
Hey --
What's the idea?
I'm coming! Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Quiet, Mollie!
What do you mean?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Here's the picture of my wife.
They wouldn't take it.
Get out of here!
Is it hard?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Pinkus.
But how do I know...?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
For heaven's sake, why not?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
Why not?
You mean here in the city?
The what?
Who do you think!
Forty dollars.
Huh?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Get the Governor on the phone!
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
We want to see you.
Say, Hildy...
Come on, fellas.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Hello, Mollie.
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job. Take it away, Fred Wilson!
She and Mollie were talking.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
I give that marriage six months.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
+++$+++ Apparently so.
+++$+++ You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
+++$+++ You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
+++$+++ Only till they get you into the local school.
+++$+++ You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
+++$+++ Give him the you-know-what.
But Grandpa, you said...
+++$+++ Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
+++$+++ Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
+++$+++ You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
+++$+++ That was a googly!
+++$+++ Never let a rat creep up on you.
Can I try?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bloody.
Sod.
Bugger off.
I only know one.
Say them.
Do you know any swear words?
You want to join our gang?
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I know a secret.
I never was.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
No, she didn't.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
Who with?
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Ask her yourself.
Could.
Would.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
They've got the real thing outside.
...and six...
...and four and five...
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
He's the worst liar.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
But Dad, It's the News.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Who pays for them?
Wow!
What's that?
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Where?
What is it?
Air-raid?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
And absent bridegrooms!
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Don't panic! Keep your head!
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Except the servicemen.
How's your war, Mac?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Why not?
What about it?
What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
And Jim.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Fair enough. The river.
Where to?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
What are you going to be then?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
It looks....foreign.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam. They could poison half the country.
We don't know anything about it
And what's that?
Oh, that.
What's that?
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
They'd gone.
No Turks.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
What did he say?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Who said anything about love?
There, there, my baby.
No, I won't.
Out.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Half the time he's bluffing.
After this dance.
You know it? It must be an old one.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Wasn't it lovely?
How are we going to cope?
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Look after yourself, Grace.
You might still have a house.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
He could always make me laugh.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Happy days. When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
It seems to have survived.
Please yourself. Let them go, if they want.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It was the best time of his life.
+++$+++ What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
+++$+++ You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
+++$+++ And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
+++$+++ To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson... ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
You're having me on, Molly.
Molly!
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
I agree.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Huh... what cone?
What?
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Who's your Daddy!
Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
No, I told you...
Baby! Stop!
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Tiny's home.
Hey, great they're back.
That's not something to joke about.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?
Thank you.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
He left!
Is your brother ready to go?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Come on.
OK.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Couple more miles up this road.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck whore!
He walks, duh.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
You know... a couple of queers.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
I was just wondering.
Nice.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Hey, wait take this.
Holy crap, thanks!
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Yeah, yeah... ...I like to fuck shit up.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
But suppose for a second you did.
But if you did.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
You mean John Wayne?
The Duke?
No, really.
How long have you been running this place?
Almost there.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
No problem.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
What was that?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Way out here?
What's that?
I don't know.
How much further?
Hell yeah.
Really fucking awesome.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Perfect.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Yeah.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
She's pretty cute.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Just grin and bear it.
What's he so excited about?
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Honk at him. Scare him.
I like sleep.
Drive through it!
What are you doing!
Quiet.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Forget it. I'll just go.
What!
What?
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Go around him.
Why are we stopping?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
It's a girl.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Enough talk, write.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Is that all... think real hard.
And...
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Come on, get with the facts.
+++$+++ Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
+++$+++ Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
+++$+++ Fuck your grandmother.
+++$+++ Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
+++$+++ Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
+++$+++ I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
+++$+++ Goddamn.
+++$+++ I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
+++$+++ Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
+++$+++ Fascinating.
+++$+++ The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
+++$+++ Hmmmmm.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
How long is that gonna take?
That's nice.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Help, help us.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Shhhhhh.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
What are you laughing at?
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
When?
I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
That seems likely.
Fried chicken. Anybody want some?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
I don't want to see that.
Tickets for what?
Grab Mary and come inside.
+++$+++ Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
+++$+++ Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
+++$+++ Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
+++$+++ Hello... ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
A couple hours!
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Jesus Christ.
I still don't.
I don't hear anything.
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't know... about half an hour.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I can't believe...
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Don't even say it.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night... ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Rise and shine.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
You find something, Georgie?
Yep, I suppose it is.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Not yet.
Yeah, no mercy here.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Yes, sir.
Huh?
Keys.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Firefly.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
I don't doubt that.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
Oh, right.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
This is way too fucked up for words.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Huh?
You said it, not me.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Huh?
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
I'm gonna go ask him.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Sorry.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Let's go see.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block... ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Well hello, officer.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Get in... now!
Who's your Daddy!
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs... ...here, take this.
What! God damn, how many?
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
+++$+++ Right.
+++$+++ Call Wydell.
Shit... fuck procedure.
I ain't got a warrant.
+++$+++ Over here, inside the smokehouse.
+++$+++ Shhhh... you hear that?
+++$+++ Where we headed?
+++$+++ My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
+++$+++ Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
+++$+++ Fit the profile?
+++$+++ George Willis... ...any leads?
+++$+++ I pray to God there is.
+++$+++ Christ, you know it's crazy... I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
+++$+++ Dr. Satan?
+++$+++ That's it?
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Mr. Willis?
Over.
Wydell.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
I guess not.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Plates match.
Aw, fuck.
I always favored the Hulk.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Right.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
And think about what you've done.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Uh... We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp. A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
+++$+++ You're fucked up, Lila. Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
+++$+++ Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
+++$+++ Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
+++$+++ It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing?
+++$+++ I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
+++$+++ Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
French?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Woof.
Like father, like son.
Gabrielle.
Great. God, I've wanted you forever.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Okay.
Please let me go with you.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I want our boy back.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Lila?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
Hunh.
That's not how he tells it.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
I've moved on.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Please. I look a mess.
Well?
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What for?
Like what?
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
Yeah? What?
Urgh.
Unnhh.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
What is it?
My little French.
Not in front of the boy.
Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Hmmmph.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Shit. Hi, honey.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shh.
You are sweet.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
I am sleepy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Shall we close up, then?
Oui.
I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Is everything fine?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Of course not.
Not at all.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you. Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
You decide. Today is your day.
Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
You what?
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Very well.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
It's okay, Puff.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Shut up, you.
Oh, Rosie.
With pleasure.
Ready!
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back. Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Nathan told my brother.
Lila, I want to help you.
Please, honey, let me in.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Be still my crotch.
Oh?
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
No. I married a midget.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Yeah?
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Really?
I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother is discreet.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Progress!
Ooka.
Oook. Oook.
Ugnh.
Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
So he's doing okay?
You were gone a long time.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
I think he's ready.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I had sold my fucking soul.
Such as what womanly things?
How come?
Really?
Have you?
I guess.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in...
That's great. It's a great color for you.
That's great.
Sure. Of course.
Shh. It's okay. It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I'm just preoccupied.
No.
Of course not.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
So, how's it going today?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
You are an animal.
I have to think! I have to think!
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Your entire body?
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Absolutely, Gabrielle. Someone from work! Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Nothing. Be right out.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
What?
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
He looks perfectly fine.
I think he's feral.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person. Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
A deer?
What?
I love you so much.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny." Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Flares?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Perfectomundo! We are ready! Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
What SPF, sweetie?
Oh, and the sun block?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Shaving cream?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Do you?
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I'll be out in a minute.
Nathan!
I don't care. I don't care! Like what, for example?
You do?
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
You really enjoy my company?
You do?
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Boy, this is good!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
I'm sorry?
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
It looks wonderful.
We are animals after all.
I'm not sure.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
What's the larger experiment?
Paper or cloth?
How's it going?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
You are a therapist, right?
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Where?
You've got to respect that.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
No.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
here, here.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
It would be my pleasure, doctor. Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Got it.
Oh, I will! Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Even better.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was... And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Mother?
Yes?
It's open... What'll you have?
Right.
You look different... More relaxed.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
You want a chaser?
Next game, ten bucks.
Hey, he's right! Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
What do you guys sell?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Pittsburgh?
Boys just passing through?
All I want's the money.
That's the way it's done.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Thank you.
You tell me.
I'll make it up to you.
You bastard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
For whom and for what?
You know what's good for him?
Do we need words?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
That's right, Miss Packard.
Oh, I forgot all about it. How's the hands?
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Lots of action. Lots of money. Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
How much do I owe you?
Will you take a check, Bert?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Oh, about five hundred.
Deal the cards.
You ever played billiards before?
Good, good.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Fifty per cent?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
You want me to tell her for you?
It's a long walk.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
Please don't get off me now.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I said we're leavin'.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
How're the hands?
All right. Five hundred.
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
When do I raise the bet?
How do we stand?
Sure.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it. Go upstairs and sleep it off.
Well, I win sometimes.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Over there by the bar.
Hey, Findley's here.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Play it again. Learn something. Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go. You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Here, I got it.
What's that supposed to mean?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
How good is he?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Thinking about what?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
What happened to you anyway?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sign up.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Man named Turk Baker?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Hello, Eddie.
Now, when did you adopt me?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Kiss off.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
You think I can lose?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
For who?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Why?
To do what?
Thanks for the drink.
I told you. I got drunk.
What's that supposed to mean?
Whaddya been so far?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
A thousand.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
I got drunk.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
You being cute?
What is?
I lost twenty bucks.
Yeah? Why?
Thought you only drank milk.
Two.
Deal.
Make it twenty.
Okay?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
+++$+++ Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
+++$+++ Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
+++$+++ You well-heeled, partner?
+++$+++ Want some free advice?
+++$+++ Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
+++$+++ What kind of straight pool game you like?
+++$+++ Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
+++$+++ What's your game? What do you shoot?
+++$+++ No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Yeah. Just like that.
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Yeah, that's what I think.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
HOW MUCH?!
Oh yeah? Where?
With what?
I told you you'd get your money back.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Talk to me, Charlie.
A son.
So am I... Sit down. Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
I asked around.
Hello, Eddie's girl... I looked all over for you.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Okay, here... Be a damn fool.
Go to hell.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
You don't need a drink.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Get with what?
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Eddie...
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Quit. He's too good.
In the gut, I mean.
How do you feel?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Well... well, now.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Whaddya mean?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Yeah. Sure.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired. And beat.
Yeah, sure has.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
There it is. I'm broke.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
I thought we came here to play pool.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Would you like to come out tonight?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
Now and then. Why, do you?
Glad to meet you.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Ten dollars.
Half and a dollar.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
+++$+++ Yeah, I'm quittin'.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
+++$+++ Heads.
+++$+++ Okay, friend. You're on.
+++$+++ You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Shoot.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Couple of bucks.
You're a pretty good player.
+++$+++ Okay, friend.
+++$+++ A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
+++$+++ Hi.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Shut up.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Go on back to the hotel.
Well, what's the matter?
Just for luck.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty. Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks. Here, you hold it.
Where's Bert?
Fifty-seven.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Oh, grow up.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
No, I want to walk.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Oh, I don't know.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Nothin'. Want another drink?
First time for everything.
Well, what's so funny?
Two. Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Yes, I'm glad.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
I love you.
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Does it bother you? What he said?
Is that what makes a winner?
Is he a winner?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Why did he tell you?
Would he know?
A loser?
What's it so hot in here for?
You wanna drink?
I got beat up. They... They broke my thumbs.
Me. It's Eddie.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too? What happens, Eddie?
Give it back to me.
Give it to me.
What are you writing?
You going out?
Do you want me to go?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one. Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Haven't you opened it?
Oh, it's not bad.
Oh, cut my finger.
Eggs. How do you like them?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
I'm getting treatments right here.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Mm hmm.
You want to go with me?
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Thanks.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Oh, I forgot.
Where you been all day?
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Sarah. Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Why?
What time is it?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Why did you do that?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
No.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy. Thank you very much, Mr...?
I drink.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I'm not.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I used to be an actress.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Fair.
Thanks. I will.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Eight o'clock.
What bus?
Fine, thanks.
Since four.
What?
Yes.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Let's go.
Thousand dollars a game.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You watch me.
Game's over, Eddie.
Preach... get it at Johnny's. You got a bet.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Very good shot.
That's what the game's all about.
Your shot.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
I hear you've been looking for me.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Where do you come from?
Is that a fact?
Now and then. You know how it is.
You have to go. He'll never stop. Leave this place. Find another.
Shhh... don't talk.
Emma...
Do you still want me to stay?
You want me to stay?
That's who you are too, Emma.
Who?
What's inside?
Have you looked inside?
Have you always had it?
I know it. What do you want, Robert?
Will you keep feeding me? How long can you live like that? Until it kills you? Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
What do you mean?
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
I only protect myself -- !
What choice did I have -- ?!
Why don't you start with me?
Yes.
Where you lived with them.
Do you remember where it is?
Was this -- "beautiful?" Before?
Who is this?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Yes.
What about... now?
Do you remember where you lived?
How much do you remember?
Yes.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you. It could help all of you. We could find some way to --
My name is Robert.
You lived like this once.
No.
Stay alive.
They are... sinister. They want to kill me.
Yesterday. They're back. Haven't seen them for a few months. I have to be careful.
Busy. I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle. A big vehicle.
What?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
It's never gonna be done. You love puttering out there too much.
I surrender --
You and that damned garden.
Yes.
+++$+++ Round back.
I guess you could say that.
I'm am architect. I'm working on a site back in --
+++$+++ You got that right.
That's fine.
Please.
Better now, son?
I know, Ellen. We'll settle down soon.
It was so real, Dad.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
What, Jim, what?
Was there anything over the hill?
Sure ... fine.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Are you sure you saw that? In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
What did it look like?
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
Okay.
That's Mars. The closest planet to us, now. That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
There's Cassius ...
There are more this year than last.
Why, Dad?
A meteorite, Dad, look!
It's got a name. Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Is the hill ours too?
Wow. Look at the mountains.
What's that, Dad?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Do we have to?
Yes.
Good night.
It's his nightmare. He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Yes -- but ...
You did? Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Where's your car?
What happened to you? Who was that?
It's probably the solenoid. Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
I'll take you to school.
Why, yes. Why?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner. I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Of course.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
We were having a little talk.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
You're looking for life?
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base. He was talking in our class. He said we could visit him any time we wanted. I'll bet he could do something.
I'm not. They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing here --
I know a way.
Hide the car.
All their lines were busy.
The State Police.
Stay here. I'm going to make a phone call.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
They'll get us.
No.
I swear it was here.
I don't see anything.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
Where, Jimmy?
Jimmy, calm down! What happened? Tell me what happened!
Yes. I can even read star maps.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I'd believe him.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge. She must've been behind the hill.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks. Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
That's quite a story. You know that, don't you?
I don't have many friends. Dad's all the time moving.
No.
Oh, I can't remember. But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
It's all this moving from place to place. We're never settled. I'm having nightmares myself.
I have school.
When?
What?
The back door was open.
What? -- I...
What happened to your other slipper?
No, Mom. It wasn't a plane.
I know. But you have a full day of school tomorrow -- You, too.
Well, come on, you two. Time to go to bed.
Jimmy's father is on the phone. I wonder if you'd take the call.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
What's his family background?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance. I couldn't get a thing out of him.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
It's really nice of you to help us.
You bet it did.
Are you all right?
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Better be. You left me for him.
You still believe in him.
I take it you've heard.
David, don't...
He's not going to listen to me.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Connie, don't hang up.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
You have to leave the White House.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Then get them out of there.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago. You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
I'll bet.
I don't know how you put up with him.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Then what?
A countdown to what?
Not really...
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
What happened?
Haven't you been watching?
Can you believe this?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
That's the good news?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
What's the bad news?
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
So sue me.
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Thanks, Pops.
What'd I say?
David, you're drunk.
This I can see.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
Dad, please...
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
You punched the President in the face?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Perfect, she's using it.
You try Martin?
Spunky?
Not listed, huh?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
What the hell is that?
Dad...
They don't know this.
Can't this thing go any faster?
That's okay. You're driving.
You still got the Olds?
Pops!
Three years.
Dad, don't start.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
So think already.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
You as well.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
I can't shake her free.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Just getting a feel for her.
Great.
We'll meet you there.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
+++$+++ Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Where's it headed?
Grey, you read me?
+++$+++ Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
+++$+++ Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
+++$+++ We've been collecting planes from all over but...
+++$+++ We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
How're we doing?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
+++$+++ We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir. If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
+++$+++ And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
+++$+++ ETA with target; four minutes.
+++$+++ The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
+++$+++ She should be shortly.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
+++$+++ Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
+++$+++ With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
+++$+++ With their shields down it might be possible.
This is ridiculous.
It had been deemed classified.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
That's impossible...
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
+++$+++ Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
+++$+++ That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
+++$+++ It's... slowing down, Sir.
+++$+++ Well, er... it's slowing down.
+++$+++ No Sir. Definitely not.
Butt-munch.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
You know me...
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Butt-munch.
Yes, I am.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
What?
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
He's doing a good job.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Oh. Sorry.
Really? Ballet?
So, what do you do for a living?
Was his father stationed here?
Your son.
Stevie... I can't...
We're already over Mach 2!
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
Damn it!
I shouldn't have left her.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
How to kiss ass.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
That'd be cool!
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
I don't need it.
It's all fuzzy.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
They let you out?
You sure?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
I said call them back.
Call them back.
Mr. President?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Above American soil?
We're leaving.
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't. Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
I'm not leaving.
Can they be killed?
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Yes.
Die.
Peace? No peace.
Many worlds...
Here... now.
Air... water... your "sun."
The dog!? You are named after the dog...
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
Yes.
Yes.
My reputation precedes me.
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You are on your own?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
I'm going after Dad.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
That doesn't look much like a library.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
I'll tell him we'll take two.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
What is it?
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
Yes. My treat.
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
All your life.
You've got it!
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
The Name of God...
The Word of God...
Look what you did!
What?
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
Arghhh! Oh!
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Schneider?
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Tapestries?
Are you expected?
I'm through!
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him. I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
You could be more right than you know.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete. Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
An old man's dream.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Where did this come from?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
I never expected to see you again.
All I have to do is squeeze.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Where is it? I want it.
So it did.
How do you know?
Don't know. Think of something.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
No?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
The Grail Diary.
What were they looking for?
My room!
You said go between them!
What?
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Pretty sure.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Lower me down.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Find something?
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
It would make me very happy.
I usually don't either.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Yes?
Yes, sir! Haaa!
Uh-huh.
Ready?
I like Indiana.
What did you find, Junior?
What did you find, Dad?
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
"J".
The penitent man is humble...
The penitent man is humble before God.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Junior...
Get out of there, Dad!
Dad?
Now, who are all these people?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
This is intolerable!
It's a new experience for me.
Those people are trying to kill us!
Nice landing.
Dad, are we hit?!
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
What does that mean?
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad, how can you?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
When?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I was the next man.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Relax.
Good.
What did you get?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
What about Marcus?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Booby traps?
What final challenge?
All right Dad -- tell me.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Brody's this way.
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Dad!
This is intolerable!
Head for the fireplace!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
And the chair.
The floor's on fire! See?!
I ought to tell you something.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What am I looking for?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
So did I.
She talks in her sleep.
Umh?
Don't worry. He won't.
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
You did!!
You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?
They want my diary.
Rats?
If only I could have been with you.
...you did it.
Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Well, what was left of him.
Found it.
Right.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Good point.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Thank God!
I'll never forgive myself --
Oh, it breaks the heart.
But what are you doing here?
It is you Junior!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
It's important!
Dad!
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
A long time to wait.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
Where's my father?
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
But, Indy --
I'll take the camels.
Come on -- come on!
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
Get that camel out of the way!
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
My name is Kazim.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
No.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
+++$+++ As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
+++$+++ Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
+++$+++ Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
+++$+++ Just a routine inspection tour.
+++$+++ Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
+++$+++ Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
+++$+++ I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors. What was it they claimed was stolen?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
You think so?
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
Finally!
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
+++$+++ They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
+++$+++ No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
You should have been there...
+++$+++ I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Yes, I understand.
+++$+++ Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
+++$+++ And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
+++$+++ Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
+++$+++ I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
+++$+++ There, you see, Captain. A rock!
+++$+++ Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
+++$+++ A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
+++$+++ I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
+++$+++ Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
+++$+++ I would say you look rather lost. But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
What's that?
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
I don't like to show off.
Nee chin lie how ma?
Dr. Jones.
Let up on the brake!
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Come one, what's wrong?
+++$+++ This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
+++$+++ Why they glow like that?
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
+++$+++ Yeah, that's what happened...
+++$+++ Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
+++$+++ Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
+++$+++ That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
+++$+++ What you look at, Indy?
+++$+++ Indy, look!
+++$+++ I ride with you, Indy?
+++$+++ Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
+++$+++ Indy?
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Step on it, Short Round!
You're betrayed Shiva.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
+++$+++ You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
+++$+++ You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
+++$+++ They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
+++$+++ No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
+++$+++ There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
+++$+++ You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
What evil?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
You will go to palace there.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
And they don't even know what it really is.
Not quite.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
What above the curves?!
Go!
There's got to be another way out.
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
So now they believe me.
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I want to go home...
What?
It's okay. You're all right now.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
What is it...?
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
A what?!
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Don't catch cold.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
You're talking to an authority in that area.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
No -- real food.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Maybe he likes older women.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
He's afraid of something.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Oh really?
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
I know the feeling...
That's good -- you're doing fine.
What's happening?
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
THE WHAT?!
PET IT??!!
Just one arm!
What?!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
It's pulling me deeper!
First of all -- don't panic!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
A SNAKE!!
A snake!
Indy! Help me!
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
What'd he say now?
And then they took their children.
Took what?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
What do you mean -- how?
What'd he say?
India...
You all right?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Siam.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Poison never agrees with me. Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along. So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
I like the service here.
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
+++$+++ What for?
+++$+++ They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
+++$+++ They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
You got it!
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
That's nice.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
Awwww...
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
You're lovely.
Yeah, sure.
They can?
I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
You've changed your mind.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
She works for them.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
I have been... I think you're right.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Gimme a minute.
Never mind that, where are we now.
Be quiet.
What happened?
What exactly?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
And don't let her know, either.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
...Shit! It's just money.
Aim what?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Don't worry, I can.
Do it.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
And Dieter?
Where?
He hung us up dry.
Well...?
Cash.
haka xuki.
What was it? What'd I say?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
You sure this will work?
I've got an idea.
Come on.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Probably.
No. You can't trust her.
You were with GRUNER!

What?
I can't see a thing.
A hard left. A hard left.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
...imagine a better grape for the region.
I can't...
What next!
...drink it.
Don't touch a thing.
One of your instincts?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What do I do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
Where are you going?
Sapporo..
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Come on, she's getting away.
On what?
What do I do?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Osaka.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Bingo.
Some agent you are.
You been had. We have.
No. What will you do.
You get time off to sleep.
And on my time.
She's got the most beautiful...s
Is that all?
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
What Happened?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Oh come on.
What am I supposed to do?
What if she says something important?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Not her. You!
This just won't work.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Even Rene?
Voice stress analyzer.
They're all in it.
Joe, be careful!
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
It lends you an air of mystery.
Just don't show fear.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Are you serious?
The drinks...Stay on them.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Who, me?
That place. By the window.
You have no taste.
The beautiful one.
Doesn't.
What did that cost?
Not that tie with that coat.
It is my business. It's my name.
Not blue enough.
This...is not going to work out.
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
Is something glinting?
But what's it look like?
Now, where would I be?
Yeah. I did it.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
It worked.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Without your pants.
Where are you going?
What happened?
...Joe.
What?
Where are you staying?
Wait.
.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What can I do? You're on your own.
How should I know?
Try another language.
What's happening?
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
You're out of shape.
Follow it.
A girl.
Beautiful!
What? What do you mean?
Where are you going? Wait!
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Why not?
Eat it.
The sand.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
You eat it.
Little late for that.
Good Idea!
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
...Just beautiful.
Holy shit!
Eating sushi?
The beach?
Now what?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
You'll be me.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
We'll change your appearance.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Who cares?
Why not?
Use my credit cards.
What about it?
We get on which plane?
You mean...just leave.
Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
What do we do?
What is it?
What am I supposed to do?
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Good. Get to a phone.
I'm back.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
You need ID in there?
Gone where?
That's not a good idea.
Black suits and helmets.
Like the guys that attacked us.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Who did?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Where are we going?
Corridor A.
Which way do I go?
Just walk down the hall?
Now what.
Door's locked.
I don't like the sound of that.
Sue them.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Find You?
I'm not leaving until you do.
Thanks.
I did. I brought you back here.
What do you mean we.
You are CRAZY!
Yeah...Who is?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They could put you back in the tube..
JOE Or what?
It can't take that long.
Did you hear that?
I don't know...To get Al.
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Too late...They want you.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Then what are you stopping for?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
This is a Fiesta!
What do I do?
What'd he look like?
What's that?
Behind us?
Anyone there?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Oh...Gooood!
Why not?
Why don't you?
You weren't listening!
What was that?
With a man in my head...
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Yeah.
You're gonna explain.
Then I'm crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yep.
Kill myself.
Loading a gun.
You said it.
Then how'd I get here?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Are you threatening me?
You've heard of the PEM114...
I told you, my name is Al.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Yeah...Who?
Who are you?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Right.
No.
Where are we now?
Shut up!
Do me a favor, Al.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Yes.
Yes.
This candid camera?
Al.
Who?
Who was it?
Arrrgh!
Don't do that.
What's going on?
I'm...inside you.
You're not gonna believe this...
Al ???!!!
Who's you?
I know you did!
+++$+++ RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
+++$+++ JOE What abilities...?
+++$+++ JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
+++$+++ JOE Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
I knew you were trouble.
Let us get to the border!
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Don't worry.
I insist.
Dieter?
Good.
No!
What is your name?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
What part what?
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Sorry...
Not that truth!
They have stolen state property.
It's a long story.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
Me.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Impossible.
Rene?
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Newer, more powerful design.
PEM115!
You've cut your hair?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Bit expensive, sir.
Sir?
What Job?
He work for us?
Surveilliance on them all.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
They took the tapes.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
He's not an ordinary man.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
That crazy guy?
What are you doing here, where've you been?
We met on the beach.
I think I've heard of you.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
...Foreign service.
It is to me too.
Al Viola.
I don't want to intrude.
Sue who?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Not...complaining, actually.
Ahhh...nothing.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Al?
Who?
Why would we want to hurt you?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Take the card.
Joe.
I will?
I feel fine.
Oh....Sure.
Oh.
Here?
Well what?
Thanks.
How do I look?
Who...are you?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Remember what?
Do what?
Oh...that's okay.
What things?
Oh.
What about it?
What?
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Don't do it!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
I noticed you staring.
Yessir...very good sir.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
Sir?
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Oh...and who is it!?
Then who did?
What?
What did you say?
What do you want?
Yes...What is it?
Yeah...I have to get away.
He wants to apologise.
What is it?
Riuji?
That's twenty feet high.
If he was able, what would he say.
But you did it. It was you.
It was you.
You are, I've seen you.
Do something!
We just don't stop.
I knew it. I told him.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Kiss her you fool.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
I'll come back for you.
Escape.
Don't worry.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
Now what?
How?
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Why did you, then?
It was my choice.
Can't you do something?
What?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Why?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
That I really don't know.
They asked about you.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What'd...you forget?
What happened?
Can you?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
This going to work?
You coming along?
You've been there?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
Why'd you ask him.
I asked him.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Hong Kong.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
That must be him. Water taxi.
How?
Now what?
What?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Beats me.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Ryuji and Gruner.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
You think I'm like that?
Then why are you smiling like that?
You don't believe me.
Hiroshima.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
How do you know you can trust me?
One chip?
What'd he steal?
He must be a good friend.
What's he done?
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
This business is over.
I'm leaving too.
You're leaving.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Who did?
He didn't.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Were you working for him last night?
You work for Ryuji?
Why did they leave?
What did you tell them?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Who else is interested in me?
Why?
Why did you stay with me?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why'd you run off?
That depends...
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Who do you work for?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
You're doing...Okay.
You're talking to me.
You did.
Why do you do it?
You talk to yourself.
That you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
Can I help?
As if your mind's not all there.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Why?
Me still. They left you alone?
I just work for the travel firm.
Yes, of course.
...Rene.
Like there's someone else here.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way?
Without what?
Do what?
Haven't seen you around.
And you.
Dinner...tonight.
I'll be right there.
Blake said that?
The poet...something he said...
...Blake
No. No one to speak of.
...I'm looking for someone.
I don't know.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Excuse me?
What could you find in this place?
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Is there anything else?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
+++$+++ Mom...what are you doing here?
Yes.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Could I have it, please.
It will be fine. You have another.
It's alright.
Why not?
Why?
+++$+++ No?
+++$+++ It will.
+++$+++ Ow?...
The other working.
This the only spare?
+++$+++ Right there.
+++$+++ So we better get started.
+++$+++ Whoever took it does.
+++$+++ Too much.
+++$+++ What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
+++$+++ Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Where?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Instant rice...?
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in." ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Yeah? What for?
What's new?
Hi, honey.
Yes, baby?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
That remote control thing?
You got a deal.
How long?
VOICE +++$+++ Lowell?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier... Push the deadline, Charlie...
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
+++$+++ Are you all right?
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Push it.
When's your deadline?
P.J.'s.
We gotta hook up.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Good.
+++$+++ Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Get me Wigand.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
When's the air date?
+++$+++ Alright, alright.
+++$+++ I don't know what he was thinking.
Shit...
+++$+++ What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
+++$+++ What does that do?
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
How about you?
Do you want more rice?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
+++$+++ The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
+++$+++ End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so. Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
+++$+++ Then what are you going to do?
+++$+++ You're taking "no" for an answer?
+++$+++ So, what are you going to do?
+++$+++ You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
+++$+++ You're exaggerating!
+++$+++ CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
+++$+++ Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
+++$+++ Yeah, I heard rumors.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
+++$+++ I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
+++$+++ And what are you implying?
+++$+++ So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again. As they start to leave...
No, I'm not...
I'm not touching my film...
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
#2 +++$+++ You alright, Mr. Wigand?
...my files! Personal correspondence...
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
#2 +++$+++ Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
#2 +++$+++ That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
#2 +++$+++ Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
#2 +++$+++ What caliber is your gun?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
Catch ya' later.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Debbie...
+++$+++ Mike... Mike... Mike...
+++$+++ How grave?
+++$+++ Are you sure?
+++$+++ Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
+++$+++ They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
+++$+++ Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
+++$+++ Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
+++$+++ And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
+++$+++ I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
+++$+++ Call me back in ten.
+++$+++ Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Catch you later.
+++$+++ Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
+++$+++ Hey, Lowell.
Did I tell you you were wrong?
VOICE +++$+++ Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
VOICE +++$+++ Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
VOICE +++$+++ You're sure you want to do this?
VOICE +++$+++ Okay. Lowell?
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yes... Jeffrey.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
What's the difference...
Where should I wash them?
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
...taping? What are you taping?
What's going on?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... Sure you don't need anything?
Thomas Sandefur...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
I didn't want to leave it there...
That's my stuff from the office...
Soy sauce...
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Try the car.
Yes, it's on the stove...
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes.
Yeah.
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Thank you, Bob.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
I got perspective.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Jeffrey Wigand...
I'm alone on this...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
I have to take a shower.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Will independent sources corroborate that?
No classes this morning?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
Oh, my God.
+++$+++ Is it too late?
+++$+++ ...you fucked me!
+++$+++ All right. See you...
+++$+++ ...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
Yeah, I'm here.
+++$+++ Alright?
+++$+++ It would be better if he called us.
+++$+++ Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
+++$+++ Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
+++$+++ What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
+++$+++ That's right...
+++$+++ I'll call you then.
+++$+++ Alright.
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Everything interests me.
+++$+++ You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
+++$+++ I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?" What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
+++$+++ In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
+++$+++ Give me a break!
+++$+++ Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
+++$+++ I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
+++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
+++$+++ How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
+++$+++ Did I get you up?
+++$+++ Alright. What did you think?
+++$+++ You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
+++$+++ Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio. That decision I've already made.
+++$+++ I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
+++$+++ I'm with Don on this.
+++$+++ Lowell!
+++$+++ Lowell.
+++$+++ Lowell.
I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
+++$+++ Who are these people?
+++$+++ Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
+++$+++ Thank you for saying that...
So, is everything okay?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were "compelled"?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
+++$+++ No shit.
+++$+++ Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
+++$+++ What "Seven Dwarfs?"
+++$+++ Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
+++$+++ You eating with us?
Don't interpret that! Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!! Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
We're there.
+++$+++ Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
+++$+++ Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
+++$+++ Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
+++$+++ How have you liked your stay?
+++$+++ Coffee?
You try and have a good time.
Where are you, anyway?
You fought for me...?! ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
You greased the rails!
You manipulated me into this...!
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
That's not the point.
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes... ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
No.
What?!
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
No. I mean since whenever...
What's changed?
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
You attract a crowd.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I heard.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
I'll call them, Lowell.
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
They do this with impunity!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Yes.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have. I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake... I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Why?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
Next to your father?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
What did you get us?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
It's obvious, isn't it?
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Good. You have kids?
You okay?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial. Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house. I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell. But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
Good. I want to talk to you.
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
What are you talking about? Where are you?
If you want to do it.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Did work.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
...but that's as far as I go...
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Like what? Your sign?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Who's that?
MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ I can't say that!
MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ He doesn't seem to be listening...
Hello, can you hear me now?
What about now?
Did he hear you?
MANAGER'S VOICE +++$+++ I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
+++$+++ Where you staying now?
Liane has filed for divorce...
There is -- there is no family.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
+++$+++ You called me.
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Hold on a minute, Lowell... ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
+++$+++ We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?
+++$+++ Just give me an example...
+++$+++ Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out... However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
+++$+++ Mike's our Attorney General down here. I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
+++$+++ Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
+++$+++ "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
"I would bet on it."
+++$+++ And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
+++$+++ And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
+++$+++ In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
+++$+++ And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
You're gonna get your fix...
A delivery device for nicotine.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not! Answer the question, Dr...
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
It acts as a...
It acts as a drug on the body?
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Jail?
+++$+++ My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness. If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
+++$+++ Hello.
Okay. I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
"Research..." You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Is that a threat?
Chapter and verse.
I'd rather play than talk about it. What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Seven...
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Baby. You are so HOT!
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Here. Got pictures.
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
What part?
-- and we are sure...
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
What a touching story.
No!
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
So she's uh, flourishing?
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
You're in a rush.
Is that... one person?
Who do you want me to kill?
Who's the pigeon?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds. Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Who's the pigeon?
That's his lawyer.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
We rest, Your Honor.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Objection, your honor!
Marylin! What have I done?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
So, that's good, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
What do you mean, was.
Yes?
What?
I already made my move, Kenneth.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
You have the pre-nup?
Well... I'm still...
Is she Asian?
I'm happy for you, pal.
He's the wrong man.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
You're in check.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
We did not.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
No frown lines. New watch?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
You want Botox?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
I'll be right back.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Is Tong older than Ming?
You said 'yes' didn't you?
You're vulnerable.
I begged you to have a baby!
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
You like kids.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
So who'd you hire?
Sweet.
Pre-Castro.
Murder!
Income tax evasion?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
You wounded me first, Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Hello Marylin.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Wait! He works for YOU?
Marylin!
You do? You do love me?
I fell in love Miles.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Hello?
That's blackmail.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Meaning my house.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
You can't prove anything.
Those are gifts.
What kind of "stuff?"
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
What do you want?
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
May I come in?
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
You don't like me?
I have a surprise for you.
Hi.
Miles.
Fabric and fringe.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
I know.
Yes. Again.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes.
Did you just propose to me?
Huh?
I want... I want to...
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Friends?
No.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
No, we're not!
Oh right. You met Patricia.
And here I thought my mother was...
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She never particularly cared for me.
Hmmm...
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Me. Yes.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Thank you.
Okay Miles.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
A little. You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Screw you, asswipe!
Marylin? When did I say...?
Yes? Marylin?
Hello?
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
To victory.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Have you tried the duck?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Howard is a beautiful person.
No, that's not all.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
But why him?
Marylin! Listen to me.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Absolutely.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Oh, for the love of...
He'll regret this.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Gotcha.
He wants a reconciliation.
No. I haven't. Have you?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
No.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore.
Why would you be here?
But you don't agree?
What does your lawyer think?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Did you see the tape?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Isn't everything?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Sometimes I forget.
You have some?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Marylin.
Dogs?
Marylin?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
He was right, wasn't he?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter? I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
You used his credit card.
Please!
Jesus.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
I guess.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Right.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Is this Ming?
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
You're not...
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Every week --
Lilly's up.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Maybe.
Who's she?
Do you know him?
Miles Massey.
Wow.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you. Neener neener neener.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Wait. I know you.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
When you have a moment.
We've outlined a settlement...
That's attorney client privilege. Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
And it's good!
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Oh brother. Here we go.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Heh heh.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
In anticipation of making you sick.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
What's Kirshner?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Nothing?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Video.
I'm not sure.
I don't know. I can assume...
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
You know what I mean when I say "it."
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
But then... But then...
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Thank you.
Rex, please.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
-- the coin?
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
She owes me a meal.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
What are they?
Is she going through with it?
What the hell is wrong with you?
No. You're not.
I am very sorry.
Sorry.
What the fuck...?
And she has...?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Who's "Patty."
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town. Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Hi, Sweetie.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Maybe next time.
Muriel Rumsey.
Who's Rex's guy?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink. Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Yes, sir?
Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. She's my idea of nothing!
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
That's an evasion.
Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you something frankly? Do you love my daughter?
You were taken for a buggy ride?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
You're a peculiar chap.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
The reward.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Yes, I know—but—
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
If I didn't I wouldn't be here! I've got it all itemized.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami— for the love of it?
Come in. Sit down.
Mr. Warne?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
"I found a million dollar baby—"
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Certainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
Are you going to see him?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, no—no.
Peter Warne!
Is that his name?
It doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
No, I'll go through with it.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
I don't know.
He's marvelous!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
It'll do no good. He despises me.
I don't know very much about him. Except that I love him.
No.
On the road.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Oh, no.
Nothing.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
I knocked several times.
Ellie—
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember. I'm sick of it!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Never mind—I'll get it myself. Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were. Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
I'll get it annulled.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
South America.
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
You can't tempt me. Do you hear? I won't eat!
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Yes. I know. Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want! But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Why don't you put me in chains?
I don't want to eat! And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to— —as long as I can get her back.
All right. That's why I sent for you. There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that. Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants. She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Lower the boats!
Absurd! All this fuss over a snip of a girl. I'm going down to see her myself.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
On a hunger strike, huh? When'd she eat last?
What happened?
We've done that already.
Personally, I think it's stupid! But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Yes, sir.
Sock her!
No? Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy. Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Naturally. You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh? All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me. Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
They're practically all the same, sir.
Yessir. There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston. "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Me? Forget it, son. I got millions.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
What happened to your money?
But the lady says—
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
. . . turn."
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Phone for help? We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Driver!
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Oh—the papers—
Huh?
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Same to you.
You bet I did.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself. Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you. Oh, Peter—
I love you.
Maybe. Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd— Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Me?
Why not?
Thank you. Am I going to see you in New York?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
That's swell!
What about money?
Any luck?
You don't have to eat the carrots. Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
What'd you give him for the car?
What happened?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Never! I'm going in and ask him—
Why not? I'm hungry.
We don't need forty cars.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
You might give me a little credit.
What're you going to do?
You! Don't make me laugh.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Here comes a car!
Amazing.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Clever.
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
You think it's simple, huh?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you. Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
Uh-huh. Want one?
Carrots.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
No. But I've got a penknife.
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking—
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Really?
What are you thinking about?
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Sure.
was so scared—that it scared—
was—but—
I don't want it now.
know—but—
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Oh, Peter—
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
Well, take them off.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Peter—
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance—a natural "piggy-backer." Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family? Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he—
Not a one.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're crazy.
This isn't "piggy-back."
I wish you'd stop being playful.
No.
I'm following you.
To New York?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Why, haven't you—?
What do you mean—starvation?
Not as long as I'm alive.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
What's the matter?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Yes.
I better go over and see her.
I refuse to resign!
You always want to run everything.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
Next week "East Lynne."
You weren't so bad yourself.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Well, you were!
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
That's Father at work, What'll I do? Peter, what'll I do?
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Thanks, professor.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
King—King Westley was in it.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Thanks. You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
He apologized for last night. Said he didn't know we were married.
Must be the Spring.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Nope. No complaints.
Thank you. My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
High time you got back.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Here—take mine.
Like what?
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
What is it? Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks. You—you had it pressed.
The pleasure is all mine.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Not at all.
Smart aleck!
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses. Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
Yeah. Come on—we're stopping here for the night.
Hey, Brat—! The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Now, just a minute—you can't—
That's none of your business.
You have your nerve! Here, boy—!
Of course I do. What do you mean—
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
I never thought of that.
What for?
That's right. You didn't.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
You must have me confused with—
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
My ticket?
Don't tell me you did it on my account! hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is— You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
Yes.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Well—of all the—well— Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you— scram.
Won't I ever see you again?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
+++$+++ I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish. If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed— Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired—and it's the only thing around.
+++$+++ Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . . People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy. You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away. From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
+++$+++ You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
+++$+++ Who—me? Want to see me?
+++$+++ Come here, you little fool!
I'm out! I'm out!
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur. Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
Whatever you say, darling.
You bet we did.
How are you, Ellie? Are you happy?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Sorry, Miss. It's gone. Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Left twenty minutes ago.
Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Here.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything. Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Yes—if he is your husband.
What's the matter? Where's your husband, young lady—
Get out!
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
You made no mistake sitting next to me. Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
+++$+++ I'm hungry.
+++$+++ What time is it?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
I've been thinking about you.
+++$+++ Oh, by the way—what's your name?
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? It's tough enough as it is.
+++$+++ The dame's too smart for him.
+++$+++ I said, the old man's screwy!
+++$+++ The old man's screwy!
+++$+++ That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
+++$+++ Up yonder. See the lights?
+++$+++ Any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
What's up?
Yes.
Throw it in the basket. What's it say? "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
What! Say, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours.
Huh?
Thanks, Joe.
Yeah, where am I?
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful! Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Well, I'll be—
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute. We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Yeah.
I am, Joe.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Joe, listen—
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles.
Free verse, huh? What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants. Yeah? Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
I ain't got a hat.
ain't got a hat—
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
I dunno.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Yeah?
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Yeah.
Collect.
Send it collect.
Mush. Mush.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
You send telegrams here?
Zeke. Git!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Oh!!
See that. They're gone!
Who?
I don't trust him.
Mebbe.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
You love them, don't you?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Where do you live?
Yeah ?—How do I know? I gotta good mind to plug you. I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it! Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you? Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Why—no—
Huh?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
You're a pretty shrewd baby. We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
What's on your mind?
Why?
What?
Yeah—wouldn't it?
That's right.
Thanks.
Say, Buddy–
What's up?
Yeah. Come on—come on!
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind.
There's a seat over there for you.
Hey, you!
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23. Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA. We got the same problem with the governors. All of them. Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks. If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist. They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match. I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door. If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close. Goddamn, Sam! If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here. The Feebees run background checks. On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got. There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim. If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake. How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know. It was Oswald. He was a nut job. Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
There were no phone records.
Hell, no! I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Always - like tits on a pig. I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. He had command of the king's English.
Swishes. They swish, y'know. Young fags, you know. They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up? These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to. Good chowder, ain't it?
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing. I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza. Truth is, I never met the dude.
Right.
There you go. Grain of salt. Two sides to every coin.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man? We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on. You're a goddamn spy.
Who the hell opened my files! You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Get home my ass. We're going to the office, have another drink. I want some company tonight.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I said Oswald must've flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
God's sake, chief. The President was shot.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie. You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people! We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here! What the hell do we really got? Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead. Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
No!... Shaw! Director of The Trade Mart? This is incredible.
Who?
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember. Stick to what you can prove in court.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. Three years later and he's still classified? They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald. Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17. He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate. He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick. He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Yes, you are. Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger. Castro did. But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die. That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison. Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you! You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up. If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me. Listen real hard.
Who do you think fed him that information? Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life. You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
Hey, where y'at, Frank? You're wasting your time here. Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI allowed.
You're not digging.
You know you keep saying that.
Yeah. They were seen together in Clinton in early September. The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
You, Numa?
What do you think, Lou?
Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought we were on the same side. What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
What's the other name?
Who is he, Joe? I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Fuck, yes. Hell, I'm already in jail. I got no reason to lie to you. I ain't no nigger.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it's no secret. That's what I'm here for.
Yeah. Clay. I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
This is Louisiana, chief. How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one. Jim sighs, saddened. Bill was one of his best men.
Yeah.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved? The President of the United States?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose! We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government. Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up. Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro. Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q. Citizen. So they close the book on J.F.K. It makes sense to me.
There's a word - orders.
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
All right, all right. Break it up.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature. "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible. I offered you love. All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Those bastards! That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters. They're sitting home reading all these lies. I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us. One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man. Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. Who found the evidence? Who set him up? Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They're not ordinary crooks.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing. It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue. There's no chain of evidence, Bill. And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository? One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy". Take it at face value. Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here. He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right? What's in a name, right? In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake. A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right? Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
I'll go you one better! Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
Gee, thanks boss.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve. We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Lord, wake me, please. I must be dreaming.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know. Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I don't see any violence, Jim. Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
I did.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...Oswald?
What about the mob, Dave? How do they figure in this?
What do you mean?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Dave, I always play square. No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry. Whenever you're ready.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I got no place to sleep. I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
...give me protection?
The Fontainbleau? 20 minutes?
It leads farther than that.
You still questioning any Cubans?
You think your investigation's been all that secret? You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects. I can't go home. I'm out on the street. The maggots are everywhere! Do you know what you've done to me? It's all over the national news now. You know what you've done to me?
Yeah, you got it. Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
You know damn well who it is.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning. We'll talk then.
Dave, it's going to be okay. Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you. I guarantee it.
Oh man, why don't you stop. This is too fuckin' big for you! Who did Kennedy? It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma. Even the shooters don't fuckin' know! Don't you get it yet? I can't be talking like this. They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die! I don't know what happened. All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God. But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness. They defrocked me. And then I started to lose everything.
Jack? Jack was a pimp. A bagman in Dallas for the Mob. He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side. Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro. Then we tried to whack him. Everybody's flipping sides all the time. It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance. Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Black, black - just give it to me. Shit. I'm so exhausted. My neck is killing me. I've got cancer. Had it for years. I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Same one. I didn't know no impersonator.
Fuckin' A. How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit? Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Everybody! The Agency. The Mob. The Cubans. Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out. Here, in Dallas, Miami. Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle. My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami. You're on the right track.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Oh, you got that? Banister's pet project. Getting paid by the government to work against the government. Beautiful. What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy. He had all those files.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
I see. Dave thank you for your time. I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car. Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
And then Sunday?
Why Galveston?
I see. And where did you drive?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
What was so appealing about Houston?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got. Thanks for straightening it out for us. There is one other matter that's come up, Dave. We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I'm sure you've seen this. Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
How could I? Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday. A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby. We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
How could I forget? You make quite a first impression. Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee? I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small... I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know. Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Come in, Dave. Have a seat, make yourself comfortable. Coffee?
There were admirals.
But you took his orders. He was directing the autopsy.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
I had the cause of death.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
+++$+++ Well, I am saying it. Bring in the jury.
+++$+++ If that's your case, you didn't have a case. I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
+++$+++ I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.
What?
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing. It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man. If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Hi, Freckle Face.
A rhinoceros. Can I stay up another hour?
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution. We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
...you heard echoes.
I want the truth.
+++$+++ He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots. He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
+++$+++ He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
We have that taken care of. You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
+++$+++ ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
+++$+++ Four to six.
+++$+++ These new people never identified themselves. They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day. I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
I'm sorry.
Aren't you being a little hard?
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right? It proves he's a liar. Keep on it, Bill.
I don't believe it!
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba? Guy Banister. Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks. Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program. He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams. It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Dammit, it doesn't add up! Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations! The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return. Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific! He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Don't get sidetracked! How does he get back to the States? That's the point. Does he have any problems?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Negative on his tax records. Classified. First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record. I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them. There are about 1200 documents... Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them. All classified as secret on the grounds of national security. It's real strange.
Now just a minute, sir! You're way out of line!
May I go? Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching. I am an international businessman. The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America. I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things. I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Nonsense. What next?
I'm well aware of this asinine article. And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Of course not! Such a pity, that assassination. In fact, I admired President Kennedy. A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Naturally. Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
One meets so many attorneys in my business. No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Clay Bertrand? Clay Bertrand? I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce. Is that the man you had in mind?
No. I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
David Ferrie.
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man. He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long. Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
No.
No. Never heard of him.
I wouldn't imagine where.
I'm not sure I understand.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered. My statements...
That's right. When I saw him on TV, I was shocked. I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant. I'll never forget that day.
Oh no! No! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Huh?
I don't think so, Jim...
And if you're wrong?
Well so do I, goddammit! So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too. But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth! It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey." While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies! Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz! And yours is, too! And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Of course, I've changed! My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane! And now King. Don't you think this has something to do with that? Can't you see?
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him. I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better. Spend a week. I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right? Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Honey, come on. The government wants you to be scared. They want everybody to be scared to speak out. They count on it. But there's nothing to be scared of.
Get a hold of yourself.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Honey, some crackpot. Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
What?
Leave us ALONE for God's sake! ...Oh, it's Lou.
Don't be. Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Did they live?
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family! All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?" What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake. It's Easter! You promised, Jim.
My sympathies.
Hi.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too. It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake. You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face. I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday. A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you? Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier. That was no accident he was in Russia. He was probably in military intelligence. That's why he was trained in Russian.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing. Oswald did badly on the test, he says. "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong." Ha! That's like me saying Touchdown here... ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test. Oswald was a radar operator. He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing. A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union. A Russian exam!
Oh, she did, huh? When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Well maybe you're right, Jim. I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed. Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning. Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold. What are you doing in here?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim? Jim, dinner.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal? Under the supervision of a doctor?
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
For sexual purposes?
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou. I'll accept your resignation.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
We need him back.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before. If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Allen Dulles?
The Warren Commission call him?
Who?
No.
Beats me. City officials. Secret Service. Dallas police. They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before. But they didn't bother running through Dealey. They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
One shooter. One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams. I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people. Hunters... patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1... green!" Or else "Abort! Abort!"
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. It sheds it's leaves the first week of March. You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon. No way. The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance. Not one. And Oswald was at best a medium shot. The scope was defective on it, too. I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting. Nobody could. And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing. The other problem is there was a tree right there... Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Time?
I took it once for a low thyroid condition... It raises the metabolism, Lou. Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington. An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou. We'll talk tomorrow.
And it ain't pretty ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I know you do, Lou. I'm doing three more lectures this month. You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa. But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead. How did Jack Ruby dies so quick? Of what? Cancer, right? A history of Nazi Germany, Lou. They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's. We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis. Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located. Think about it. Think the unthinkable - question everything.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught. Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou. Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job. Lou, come alive. These things are not adding up.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65. Two in the morning on some highway. A hit and run.
There was Rose Cheramie. A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
Graveyard dead. August this year. A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas. The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go. No record of them ever being questioned.
What are you driving at, boss?
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
Post Office.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Remember whose office this was back in '63? 531 Lafayette Street.
I know David - a strange character.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Oh no!... How bad?
What's wrong, Lou?
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire. I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
No, it can't!
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Are they? Why would they?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury. What is your response?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Just think... just think. What happened to our country .. to the world... because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Does it matter? Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how I know? That picture of yours. The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
You never ask a spook a question. No point. He'll never give you a straight answer. General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA. Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
...don't think so. When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em. These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza! They took out the President of the United States! That's entertainment! And they served their country doing it.
He's done it before. Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro. No big deal. In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket. Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams. Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop? Part of the scenery. The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Just speculating, I guess. How do you think it started?
Well, thanks for coming.
I haven't yet. I don't have much of a case.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I don't... I can't believe it. They killed him because he wanted to change things. In our time - in our country?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever. If this is another type of threat, I don't...
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
Yes.
You're so naive, mister.
What's the problem? What's the problem? Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison? I better go.
Never. Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go. I said enough. I said all I'm going to say.
Sure. 'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut. Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie. But he was there all right.
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Where is Banister in all this?
Was he there often?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. I wasn't really part of the operation, you know. I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse. There were all these Cubans coming and going. They all looked alike to me.
I didn't say that. All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum. But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it. Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
And he never hit you before?
Here's my problem, Jack. You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
He'll never make it. If he wins, they'll kill him. He wants to avenge his brother. He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years. Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is. Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
I just don't want to do it. What else?
No, she could get hurt. If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful. All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Even my own wife, chief, Who's wondering where I am?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with. The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent. Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
That's it.
Less than you would guess. Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence. We...
Germany.
Splendid, love to see them.
We can use all the support we can get. I think these might interest you.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison. Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Uh huh.
Yes.
+++$+++ And how tall are you?
+++$+++ I need some information from you then. How old are you?
+++$+++ Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest. Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
+++$+++ Virginia or Elizabeth?
+++$+++ Hello. Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Well, the public attention it would attract. And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Thanks.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
This looks pretty good on me.
Can I help you?
Won't forget?
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
But then you told her you were home.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
Course you didn't.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I can't believe you do me this way.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Go ahead.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Uh-huh.
What's the problem?
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
That requires me goin' out tonight?
What?
What'd ya mean?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Three years.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
You.
You were there for me.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
And you didn't tell the Police?
How'd you know where he was?
Why were you with him?
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Can I have a word with you?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
We are. Don't worry about it.
She knows it's my case?
What's she willing to give us?
What's she want?
She sound scared?
What's going on?
Great, you're here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
But you're not going to stop her?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Fine.
Can you do it or not?
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Thanks.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
What's this?
What's in it?
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Arrest me.
I'm not saying another word.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Suspicion of what?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
I doubt it. Who's your friend?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
I'm just tired in general.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Spain.
You'll get over that.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
We're partners.
I never lied to you.
I didn't use you, Max.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I told him I might.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Less ten percent.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
He's already there.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Uh-huh.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Ray wants him.
He's liable to shoot you.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
How'd you find out?
In a dress.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
What if he checks it?
Where's the rest of it?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
It'll be more than that.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Do you think they bought it?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
What if I've figured a way?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Which one?
More or less.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
That's my job.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
When did you decide?
Why?
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
You know some interesting people.
Has he hinted around?
I see.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
You think he's got a thing for you?
I called you last night.
He was here?
Will Ordell go for that?
Right around here, in the food court.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
They seem to like the idea.
I go back to work tomorrow.
I don't care.
I'm old enough to be her father.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
"American President"
Catching a movie.
I walked right past you.
Well, hello.
Fifteen thousand.
Does something else worry you?
Bigger?
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
It's not really something I think about.
You're not old. You look great.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Why?
We talked.
He came by.
He told me last night.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
'74, I think.
The Delfonics.
Uh-huh.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
It looks nice.
Sure.
Yeah.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Black's fine.
You get a chance to use it?
If you're having some.
What'dya think?
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
With ten thousand? Nine.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
He's the one who wants you.
No, you didn't. What branch?
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
What did they want to know?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
What have they told you?
You're not tired of it?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
You gain weight?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
That doesn't sound dark.
Is it dark?
I'd love one, but not there.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I don't think so.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can I see your I.D.?
Who do you think I am?
Okay.
+++$+++ With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
+++$+++ And cooperate? You might get probation.
+++$+++ I beg your pardon?
+++$+++ Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Not every day?
Do you live together?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
What about you?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
If it'll make you happy.
I have no idea.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
There was a guy with Melanie?
What did you do after that?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
Where's the bag she gave you?
But you didn't do that.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
Si.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
That would be one point of view.
Yes. All those things are true.
Uh-huh.
Ever been tempted?
You didn't count it?
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
You said that the last time.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Was she there?
She told you that?
What did you say?
And splittin' with her?
What's her story?
Who's the other one?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
You talk to him?
You two meet?
A Broadway shopping bag.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
What are you doing?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
No.
He sells guns.
You never asked me if I did or not.
If I'm working, I can help you.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Can I smoke?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
You planted that shit on me.
What the fuck is that shit?
Yeah?
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Do you got something for me?
Yeah, do you like it?
Hi, Melanie.
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Keep it between us girls?
Dreaming.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
You already knew that?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
He said he didn't know about it.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
What were you two fighting about?
How long you been with Ordell?
Uh-uh.
Killian's.
Sure.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Buy ya a beer?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
What does she think she's gettin?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
How do you know she did that?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
I need to talk to you alone.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
What'd you care?
Uh-huh.
I can do that.
I'll give ya ten.
Managers get ten percent.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
So we need two people, two women.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
But you don't?
Yeah, I think a woman.
A woman.
Who?
That's a good idea.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
What did they say?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
You told them that?
Didja tell 'em anything else?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
You told em? You told em it's me?
How the fuck they know that?
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
Talk to you tomorrow.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
All your money's in Mexico.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
I just came here to talk.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
I understand woman, damn!
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
What the hell you doin'?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
They told me.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Beaumont Livingston.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
They asked.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Sure.
Yeah.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
This one.
You sure?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
I'm carrying it.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Are you sweating?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
We're leaving now!
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
Uh-huh?
You live with him.
Does that bother you?
No.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Yeah.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Sure.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
About five years ago.
I lived there for about nine months.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Did you ever go I one?
C'mon, don't lie.
Were you a disco guy?
With Ordell?
Where were you?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
So where did you go?
Were you a disco girl?
I thought you were sixteen.
You're fourteen years old here?
The roller disco one.
No thanks.
It's a diet thing?
What's a Metrix?
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
You okay?
Is it ready to go?
Bank robbery.
Uh-huh.
Two months shy of four years.
Susanville.
Four days ago.
Sure.
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
It's boring, isn't it?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
How am I supposed to know that?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Max Cherry.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Jesus Christ.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
It's in there.
Pull the car over.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Where you shot her.
Then what?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
How long was she in there?
Came outta where?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Where's the rest of it?
Louis?
In the chest and stomach.
Pretty sure.
Uh-huh.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You know how she is.
Twice. In the parking lot.
I shot her.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Not now, pick me up.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Did you get it?
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Uh-huh.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
What does that mean?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Yep.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Sure.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
I follow.
Yeah.
What did he do?
Who was Beaumont?
Who was that?
I'm in my underwear.
C'mon in.
You're outside?
The moon -- I dunno
I dunno.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
This one's for the ignition... ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Then what?
That's good money.
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
As low as two.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Thanks, Baby.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Have fun.
Watcha gonna see?
Hold on a minute. Where you going?
You better be, motherfucker.
You sure?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it. I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
My money's in that office, right?
Turn left.
It's the next street.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Call her, tell her the combination.
Have her bring the money here.
That I gotta see.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
And where's Jackie?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
And you did that to protect my interest?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
Well, give it to me then.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
How the fuck did he find me?
How'd you find me?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
That's all?
I'm alone.
I thought you might be asleep.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
You know who this is?
What's up with this shit.
Where is it?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
You didn't hear?
Somebody already did.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
I got some more business for ya.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies. I get my money back, don't I?
Hey, Max.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
House.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Haven't a clue.
You don't say.
Livingston, huh?
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
You think you could do that?
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
I know that.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
It's in my bag.
Gonna have to put up cash.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Hello. Hey, Jackie... No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
We're back.
Who is it?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Give me his home number.
He leave town?
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
No! Oh God.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain. Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
What isn't happening?
Then what are you doing here?
What are you then?
Home? This is your home. You're dead.
Where do you want to go?
Like Della.
Just to see you. That's all.
I see.
Della?
It's fun.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Are you all right?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Grass never did that to me.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
How do you know?
LET GO!
Daddy. Let go.
You're hurting me!
Daddy!
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Short? It's ended.
You know, you got a strange line here.
I could have told you that.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
I'm hanging up.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Maybe the demons are real.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
They're not interested, Jake.
There's nothing to expose.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
It's hard to explain.
That's right. We did.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Don't go? I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe. Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Now what?
Mom, it's ...
It's cold.
There was a bang.
Daddy, what was that noise?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Used you?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
I'm too messed up to teach.
I am.
Doctor. Ph.D.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
What else did he say, Jake?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
You think they're connected?
No. Not really ...
A couple of weeks, I think.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
What do you mean, demons?
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Shit!
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Jake, you need to rest.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
What are you doing?
What? By myself?
You ever read Meister Eckart? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Louis, you're a life saver.
I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I had this weird flash just then.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I can't relax.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
She hates me, Louis.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She told you that? Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She talk about the boys?
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Who?
Turn on your right side. How about the other "right?" I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
A bit.
I saw Sarah the other day.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Hell, you think I am?
But I see them.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please help me.
I need your insight, your intuition.
Yes. I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob, this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
See them? What do you mean? Physically?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Ah!
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
It's good to see you.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Whataya mean, no record?
Jacob Singer.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
New? He's been here for years.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Jacob, what can I do?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
She was good in bed, though.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
It's not healthy with it closed.
I'm not cold.
What was that?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
They stole it.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
WHO ARE YOU?
Goddamn you!
Oh God!
This isn't happening.
Where have they gone?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Where are they?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Oh? Where you going?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today?
You can have anything you want.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote?
Jake, what is it?
You look upset.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
I don't know you.
Why won't you answer me?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
WHO ARE YOU?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Sit down.
Sit down, Jake.
Oh yeah? Try leavin' without me.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Please.
Bullshit!
I can waitress. I'm good.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
What's gotten into you?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I have no idea. I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? Vietnam? ... What experiments?
It might be for me.
I can do anything I want.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Stay away from me, Jez.
Let go!
Jezzie?
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
He said you didn't have one.
He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
While you were in the shower.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
How come? The army?
Remember that.
I know.
We're all angels, you know ... ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. Love me a little?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. Hello! Anybody home? Anybody in there?
Are we in Brooklyn?
Am I home?
Here. I'll do it.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Don't gimme that.
I can't do it.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Coming here?
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Get your clothes off!
Get your clothes off.
The numbers stop at 107.
It's gone to the top.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Hey, I'm here.
Why? What for?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
We're at Della's.
Oh, come on. It's early.
You okay?
They weren't human!
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They're like demons, Jez.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
What's wrong?
How's it going?
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
I just want to look ...
Wait. Don't.
Is that the one who died?
Not to me.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Why you left.
That's Sarah? I can see what you mean.
Lemme see.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
The best.
A good lay.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
They're weird names.
No. The little one.
Your kid dropped it off.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Did you look around the headboard?
Where'd you leave 'em?
You up?
What happened to you?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
The room!
What do you think?
That help?
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where are you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Jake, is that you?
I don't know what to say.
No. I couldn't.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Well that's good to know.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
Just relax.
Pleasant dreams.
It's strong stuff.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? Stick out your tongue. That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
You come here often?
So why tell me now?
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Who then?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
Like it was yesterday.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder. Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
If you're lucky.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Hot. Where do I sign?
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
How 'bout over there? No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
I no from around here.
Help me!
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Total delirium.
What?!
What is wrong with you?
We're not going to hurt you.
Please come quietly.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Push 'em back.
Total delirium.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Last night! They were as real as you are!
That's a lie. My family was here.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ...
I'm awake?
Where am I?
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Call my chiropractor.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
You come home with me.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire. I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Oh God. I know. I know.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
You've seen them?
What do you mean?
I don't know what to do.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Who is?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay? Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I just need to talk.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Still married, Jake?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Paul Gruneger!
Jacob Singer?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
How did it happen?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Died?
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
+++$+++ Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
+++$+++ On top of him?
+++$+++ I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
+++$+++ Is he all right?
+++$+++ I have some ice from the machine.
I don't have all day, kid.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Yes it does.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Pause play.
Speaking of which, duck!
You got lucky.
Punk?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Done?
We made it?
I don't know. Nothing.
His mother?
Can we blow it with just two?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
What's that?
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What are you doing?!!
It's locked!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
We don't have time to argue!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Duck fuckers?
Sergeant!
Can't shut em' down from here.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Bomb?
Sergeant? We thought you were...
He came for me, I had to run!
He....He...
Thorgan, pull us in.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Uh-oh.
Thorgan, suit up.
Let's move out!
Two more charges to go.
What are you doing back?!!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
They're back here.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Shit!
Everyone okay?
Better let me.
You see that?
Nice touch.
Creepy.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Suit up.
And now we're all out of it.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
I don't know!
Then stop talking and work faster!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Thorgan? You coming?!
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
We could convert fission transistors.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
What?
But I didn't see...
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
You just keep an eye out.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
You got that right.
Not a chance.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus what the hell is that?
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
You're a teacher.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Get them in the lab!
We need weapons.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Where is he?
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Negative.
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Jesus, God!
Pull me in!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
I get it.
Old woman?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I'm stuck!
I know you.
I think so, why?
I think I had some when I was eight.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Rizzo, you okay?
Okay, good tip.
Eat me.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Got it. You ever space walked?
You?
Not so bad.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
And what happend to ...?
Were you close to your father?
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
That's why I'm here.
What's this?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
What if we don't?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
I guessed.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Outta here?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Where are you going?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Oh I like her a lot.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
That's really funny.
She needs a little time.
She broke my fucking nose!
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
It's time.
Now what?
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
I'll help you in.
Okay?!!
Kaboom.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
Yuck.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Close the fucking door!
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
You lost the charge?
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
+++$+++ I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
GO, GO, GO!
+++$+++ The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Thank you.
We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
+++$+++ Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
+++$+++ Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
I'm missing two!
You're so bossy.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
Hurry! She's lost it!
You think it killed . . . Yeah, I guess not.
I'm gonna spew.
This is what it means right here.
What do we do?!!
What are you doing?
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Jesus!
Later.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
No.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
You killed him?
Are there any other shuttles?
+++$+++ You need to get laid!
+++$+++ I'm afraid I cannot assist.
+++$+++ Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
+++$+++ Kay-em 14.
+++$+++ I love you.
+++$+++ I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
+++$+++ Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
+++$+++ A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
+++$+++ Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
+++$+++ Oh, alright.
+++$+++ Do I have to?
+++$+++ Who are you apologizing to?
+++$+++ Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
+++$+++ Ow!
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
+++$+++ Sory...
+++$+++ I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
+++$+++ I didn't say I was good at it.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
No! He's coming with us!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
We're missing two of the kids!
But?!!
What?!!
Thirty seconds.
The power's back up!
Something's wrong.
How do you know?
What?
I don't understand...what does he want?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
I'm sending you the files.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
How do you open the damn door?
Guys, please come with me!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Are we locked down?
You're not going anywhere.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Azrael can you repeat that?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Are you finished?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
But...I...400 years?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
30? How long was I out?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Can we get through these?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Yes!
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
What have you done?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
My cars. And a comic book.
Just a favor for your old man.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
My boat's neat, dad!
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?
He's taken him!
Full throttle! To port!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
No!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
What about us?
Did you get him in the head?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
The bilge pumps. There --
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
What's that one, there?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick!
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast.
What do you mean 'We...?'
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
This is Matt Hooper...
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
You got it.
You got it.
You got it.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
What?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Colorful, isn't he?
Home... New York?
Can you do that?
Thank you.
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Michael! Come inside!
He's sitting in it.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Can you stand something to eat?
You're very tight, y'know? Right there.
Love ya.
Be careful.
Older, sillier.
I think they make you look sexy.
Don't forget these.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it.
Feed the dogs.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Like you're from N'Yawk.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
Do you see the kids?
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Just sign it, Larry.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Got a pen on you?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
I'm going home.
She's right.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Sure he is.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Only 24 hours!
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Do I need any more authority?
I can't imagine why.
Just keep kicking.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
No... You think we can get back with those?
I can't stand here doing nothing!
It's a whale out there.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
This is quite a place.
I wish it would rain...
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks.
That means closing the beaches.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
Be careful, for chrissake.
Why don't we just tow it in?
They must've hit something.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
We gotta get back soon...
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Where'd you get all this?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
What is all this stuff?
Chum?
What do we do?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Florida license plate.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Our friend, the shark.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Dynamite! How was your day...?
What d'ya mean?
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard?
Who are you?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Pretty stiff.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
You here for the summer?
You from around here?
Think she might've run out on you?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Christine what?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
We never had any. What's the problem?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
We're not even sure what it was.
Do I set the goddam hook?
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
One more after this, then I'm going home.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
You wanna call it a night after here?
Yep.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
You love sharks?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
+++$+++ Well... is everything all right?
+++$+++ I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
+++$+++ ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
I've got all these signs here...
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
He's under!
No way! He can't!
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- Slower! Throttle back ---
The shaft is giving.
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
I think I can top that, Mister...
And I'll drink to yours.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Ever see one like this?
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Over there!
I'm okay...
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
Down here, Hooper!
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
What's that supposed to prove?
Anti-Shark cage.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Let me see your hands...
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Transplants?
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I don't have it.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
+++$+++ I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
+++$+++ You know how I feel about her.
+++$+++ Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
I don't think so.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Okay.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
It does?
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
I try really hard, actually...
What, you mean as friends?
You know it's okay.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
Why?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Wait, let me take that.
No...
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
What?
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
We're getting a stretch limo.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
I totally heard you did.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Were we together?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Well, I do.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Oh. That's a relief.
Is that normal?
Really? What are they like?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I'll try to drop by later.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Or something.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
But you copy my work every week.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
So that's cool with you, then?
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I know.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I don't know...
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Cool.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What a trip, man.
Did you hear it's yours?
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Hey man.
+++$+++ What are you talking about?
+++$+++ I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
+++$+++ Excuse me?
+++$+++ No... I guess not.
+++$+++ I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
+++$+++ Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Oh, go fly a kite.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
I know enough.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Oh, God...
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
I'm a junior.
PARTNER +++$+++ Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
PARTNER +++$+++ Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
PARTNER +++$+++ What? My eyes are not lying!
PARTNER +++$+++ You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
PARTNER +++$+++ Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
God, you're so young.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
But you're old!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
No.
What?
I don't know.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
Oh, okay. Like this.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
I actually know this one.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Come on, I have something for you.
Nope. We're safe.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Consider it your musical education.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Why?
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Why? What the big deal?
You're something else.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
That suits you.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
The Wizard of Gore?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
You don't have to do that.
Hey, I like this.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
Yeah?
You know... it's parts...
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
No, he's the dad.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Oh.
Like what?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Why aren't you at work?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
When was this, like '96?
Yeah.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
I rock a Harmony.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Viscera?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Really? Fingernails?
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
You should try Adderall.
Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Juno? What's going on?
Elbow.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
This is the baby. Your baby.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
I went to the doctor today.
Nothing...
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Can I take your coats?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
+++$+++ My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
+++$+++ Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
+++$+++ Your name, please?
Thundercats are go!
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Tore up from the floor up?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
You mean like couples?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride! These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
Well, you know where the lavatory is. You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Keith's hot.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Hot!
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
You sound shocked or something.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
What?
Share the love, Tits!
Or stage parents!
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
I'm pregnant.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
You're not listening to me.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other." "All that's missing is your bastard."
The Penny Saver sucks.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Aha! You love him.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Only the one in my pants.
Is this Juno?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
What do you make with that?
So. What's that thing?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
You don't say.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
It's a loft.
Yeah, downtown.
Looks like it, yeah.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Don't mock me.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Can you see it?
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
They're yellow.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
I suppose anything's possible.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
That's not true!
...That's not true.
Jeez... Adele!
...Anything else?
What's Early been in jail for?
Yeah.
Adele... are you serious?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Hold still.
That's me.
You took this picture?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
What's this?
I'm cool.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
You dropped this.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Is it hard to learn?
Are you takin' the pictures?
Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Karma.
...Thank you.
...Pardon?
Hi, I'm Adele.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
What's wrong with her?
...I don't know.
...thank you.
Yeah but, what is it?
What the hell is this stuff?
Early, what're you doin'?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Shush, Adele.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
What if they're dangerous?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
What'll we do out there?
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Almost.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Early, you are so sweet.
No sir.
What do you need a Bible for?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Where you from Walter?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Walter Livesy.
Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.
You two been busy in here.
...and?
So tell me... what happened here?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
...Ha.
Damn right I do.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Yeah?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Sure.
Yeah.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Dahlia, no.
...Then some.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
Henry Lucas.
This guy killed a mess of people.
This the book your writing?
How much do I owe you?
...Too bad.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
So what do you do Early?
Brian.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Tight fit.
What about you?
What are you going to do?
Then try again,
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Brian I want him out of our car!
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I'm finished.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Look again!
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
Who said he's my good buddy?
Fuck!
I don't want to talk about it.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I heard that.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Lighten up...
Funny, very funny.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
I like that.
What did he sound like on the phone?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
...and I think I know why.
So how's it going?
Thanks. What are you doing?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Thank god!
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr!
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
Nervous?
Any word from that gallery?
...You know what I mean?
You were plenty hot.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Early, just think...
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
...never?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...Need a hand with those bags?
Where's Adele?
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
What is it?
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Wasn't my fault...
+++$+++ Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
+++$+++ ...That'd be my guess.
+++$+++ No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
+++$+++ Without his car?
+++$+++ Where would we find him?
+++$+++ Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
+++$+++ Who are you?
+++$+++ Now you gotta be careful.
+++$+++ You're clean.
+++$+++ Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
+++$+++ Were they wearing condoms?
+++$+++ With how many people?
+++$+++ Have you ever had anal intercourse?
+++$+++ How many times have you gone unprotected?
+++$+++ Yes. Altogether.
+++$+++ How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
+++$+++ How old you?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Why not? You stink.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
How much you gonna take?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Good luck?
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
So.
What are you talking about?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs. He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Why I give pennies?
Why I do what?
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Bet.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I know what you mean.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Man, this guy is really good.
I hate this game.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Can you do it man?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
The cartoon?
Unzip my pack, yo.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
They're gonna tell their grand kids. That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
It's no big deal, right?
It is right.
Why?
Did she suck your dick?
Telly.
78th.
Probably.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
Are you hungry?
What do you want?
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Yeah.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
You know what else?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Yeah.
How long did you fuck her?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
She can fuck?
Well, how was it?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
What do you think?
Shit.
Casper, where is he?
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Man we fucked him up.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Na.
I had a female vagina last night.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
You goin'?
Where you goin' tonight?
Where you at?
Casper! Was up kid?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
What?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Do you care about me?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Nothing?
But I'm scared Telly.
How do you know?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I like you too.
Come on.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Yes.
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Tonight?
Yeah. I can understand that.
She won't? Why not?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
At the block party?
You have?
Is it cold?
Hold on.
Right now?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Here. Swallow.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
What is it?
Who are they?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Of course I do.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I wouldn't believe it?
Why is that?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Because, you know why. You know.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Yeah.
I guess so.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Come dance.
Dance!
+++$+++ I'm sorry.
+++$+++ The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
+++$+++ Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
+++$+++ Have you ever had anal intercourse?
One.
15.
+++$+++ Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
+++$+++ Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
+++$+++ Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
+++$+++ I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Thanks.
Yeah?
+++$+++ Am I getting warm?
+++$+++ Are you in trouble with the law?
+++$+++ Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
+++$+++ No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
+++$+++ Miss, would I be prying?
Sorry.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Yeah.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
What?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Hello.
I'm coming.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I only did it once and...
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Good luck.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Passion...
Foreplay. Foreplay.
No, I didn't bleed.
I didn't bleed.
I know.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yeah?
OWNER +++$+++ Whah you say? Dissdee?
OWNER +++$+++ I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
OWNER +++$+++ Whah is dissdee?
OWNER +++$+++ Whah?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Because he can like climax you up to that...
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah.
It's like...
Sweet.
Yep.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
What?!
Holy shit. That's all true?
Oh god. That's horrible.
No.
Yeah?
I hate 'em.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Not too late.
Not too late.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Mom.
But then I won't need your money.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Yep.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Nah.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
It's me. Telly.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
It was... it was.
To come?
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
It's very monotonous.
It's grandmother style.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
OK.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid. Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Sit down!
What?
Get off me!
It's all a big game isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place. It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
You're a lying bastard!
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
Then let's narrow it down.
Then what's he talking about?
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
You got it on the board.
What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No.
What do you want?
No it wasn't.
How'd you get in here?
I wouldn't know.
You don't have an investigation without me. You got that?
Maybe you should.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
Not what -- who. Morpheus. The Greek God of dreams. Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Morpheus.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
What do you mean, no?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
What's that supposed to mean?
You are! I don't like you.
Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
What are you saying?
What kind of problem?
Yes.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.
What's the first street?
What are you talking about?
It'll take hours. You can't make me do this.
You want me to what?
Ready for round two?
What is it?
I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
You alright?
How is she?
We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
You still having a problem with this?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first- timer.
Sorry.
No shit!
Take it easy. Both of you.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
You think he's dirty?
What do you think?
Local?
Run it down.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased.
Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson!
He was with me?
But a hundred men could move him.
What was suspicious about him?
Did anyone look suspicious? Think!
Did anyone stand out?
Maybe you're reaching a bit? I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Why does he call Sanderson?
You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
Very good. How did you know?
No! Wait!!
Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies.
You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
No. As usual you're wrong. It is her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
The game's over. You lost.
She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.
No you haven't. And even if you had it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
By that time the game will be over.
Emotional? I expected more from you.
Hello, Peter.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge- -
They think that you and I are doing this together.
What word did you leave last night?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Hello.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know. Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
You like to brag, don't you?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Just for that no hint today.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
I'm just trying to play the game.
Just like who?
But you said you didn't know her.
Why her?
You know her?
Hello?
You're not going to tell me that.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
Where is she?
What?
Why not?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
And -- what path is that?
Did you know her?
Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Just a second. Hello?
I haven't got time for this.
Who is this?
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down. Put it down, David.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead. You can't undo it.
What scars?
Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?
What is it?
1985. Hans Korshaud.
There's three. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. The Boston...
Now what?
D2-d4... b1-c3... and c1-f4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Nope. Nothing.
No problem. We're in.
Sure. We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks.
+++$+++ You're losing me.
+++$+++ He was watching you.
+++$+++ Why did he what?
He already did once.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before. This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
I just can't believe it.
Fuck off!
Don't patronize me! You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
--the same type as the girl who got killed. Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
You're damn right! I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Nice meeting you.
No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things.
I know he really likes you.
Do you like my dad?
That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Is your dad here?
Uh huh.
Who's Kathy?
But you promised.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
You ready?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
What is it, dad?
Has he gotten through to any?
Who told you that?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
I see. You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
What are you doing up?
Congratulations, dad.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Yeah.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood?
No Frank. No prints.
No prints.
Not much. I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
Bingo.
Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Six, eight hours tops.
Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.
Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Did you see his face?
The most logical choice.
We're going to work on the message.
What does that mean?
What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What?
About a quarter to one.
Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
That's a big area to cover.
He moves around a lot. Why?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
What did he mean by Huxley?
Peter's right, Captain. He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
This ain't no photo.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I don't think it matters. Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
I was thinking the same thing. He must be local. It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name. What about this?
Anything else?
What about the way he arranged the body?
Kathy?
But we heard him.
--Edmonds. I know. You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
I'm busy right now.
What do you think he did?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that?
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Did you send the car?
Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
This is insane! Can't you see what's going on. The killer wants me out of the way. He's setting me up.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Answer the question.
Where were you last night?
Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
He uses castles...plural -- then says "can't move me." Singular. Not can't move us.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I?
It's a commercial area. No one lives there.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you. There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
It doesn't make sense.
"Is". Did you tell him about the institute?
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
That's it?
Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
You want me to go with you? Maybe I can help.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. She's a psychologist helping us out.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It says: From Debi. Please call me at home.
I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?
Feel like practicing?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him?
Mate in five.
Who says something's on my mind.
About what?
You have something you want to say?
You're always in the middle of a match.
Peter...
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Then I'll transpose.
You opened with the English. Lutz won't use it. He opened his first game with it.
What are they, please?
Could you please do me a big favor? In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess. Could you look and tell me what they are?
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard. I called you earlier about a book.
+++$+++ We'll call you back.
+++$+++ I can check and call you back.
+++$+++ Bainbridge Books.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you. You made a difference.
You beat him.
Are you going to come tonight?
Of course not.
He didn't tell you either.
No he didn't.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
It could be anything.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Why not?
Because she killed herself!!
But I do.
It's not that easy.
You don't understand.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you. I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I've been... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You really haven't seen my best side.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Hi.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Where's the note?
A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad.
Exactly. It's the key.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Peter...
Peter, you have to admit--
Nothing.
I tried again and got through.
They're not delivering. I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
Did you call?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
What do you want on it?
Call room service.
No.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Then show me who you are.
Does anyone?
Nobody could attack you. You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses. You're cut off from everyone around you.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Yes you are. You're playing word games.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
And you?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm sorry.
I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
No. You were talking about chess.
You always want to talk about me. What about you?
I'm sure you are.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Why?
Doesn't that scare you?
I know you didn't
I know it was bad.
Relax.
You're not?
Because I work with them.
Of course.
You have to win every point, don't you?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
That's not fair!
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
Do you?
What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Oh, but it is. He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him. That's a game. It has rules and objectives.
In a way.
I think it's interesting.
It wasn't intentional.
It's going to be a long night. It could take hours before we know something. You should try to eat.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
She could be dead now.
I can't right now. I've got a game.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
No you didn't.
What are you looking for?
Well, I think I've had enough.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
It is.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies?
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. The strong win. The weak perish.
Not really. You see your goal and you go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
When I was very young.
Yes.
Uh huh.
No. I don't.
How come you don't stay with them?
Yes.
It's alright.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I'm not nervous.
No, I want you to do good. That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Hello, Peter. You played an interesting game last night. Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82. I'm glad it helped you.
That's a better one.
In the Arctic ice.
Lyssa ...
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
All directions are the same here.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Will your power outward.
You must move away from the Center.
Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn.
I know it.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Colwyn ...
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Colwyn.
I can't wait either.
I lied.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
We're almost married.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Well, you're beautiful.
That's worse.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command! You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
You will go alone.
They have Lyssa!
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I forbid you!
No! You cannot know that!
You're coming with us.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
Use your sword.
I chose the wrong passage.
Where the spiral begins.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Yes.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
He has come for Lyssa.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
You will know, in good time.
I'm not sure.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
I will find her!
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
What do you see?
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
The Fortress moves?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
There is nothing.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
There is no other way.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
The new Queen lives.
The White Castle has fallen.
Each to his fate.
It is today?
I road them often in my youth.
They can be saddled.
Do not let the waters touch you.
Slayers!
How did you know?
You will not, then?
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me. Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Let me comfort you.
You too are lonely.
Even by you?
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Am I not worth returning to?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
What else is left for a man without friends.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
I have need of friends.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
He saved our lives.
Staying alive.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Naturally.
You're resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Go. I command you.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Go, join them.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Hand over your dinner.
These we'll pay for.
We must try to get horses.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
No.
I'm not hungry.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
When did you last sleep, boy?
That I promise you.
To the place where Death lives.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
You will follow me.
I know you.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Fame.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
My heart stays here.
Quell?
A small house.
No.
We'll meet you at the inn.
I'm glad. I'm very glad.
What is that awful looking place?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life. I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
You!
Would you settle for a boar?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
We meant only to please you.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ... What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
I only want one.
I'd wish for a puppy.
Smart lad. Bring me my spices!
I ... ... am Titch.
You can have half.
I have a cinnamon bar.
No.
No.
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Oh, my poor stomach.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
We have plenty of hares.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Put me down, you lout!
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
They'll trample him to death!
He is the King.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
THE BEAST +++$+++ He will not come. You will be my queen.
THE BEAST +++$+++ Then he will die!
THE BEAST +++$+++ These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
THE BEAST +++$+++ Then look!
THE BEAST +++$+++ You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
A match for your son, I think.
That I am, my lady.
I knew.
Yes.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Freylag's stronghold?
What news from our friends?
Modred! Impossible!
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Yes. We lost five.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
With an old voice?
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
That is true.
It is too late. He has drunk.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
Fewer will survive them.
She had another name once.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
She has the power of vision.
Yes.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Many have perished in that maze.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here. We'll find her.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
No.
You lie!
Why must you know?
Of what?
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Yes.
Those are reflections. <u>This</u> is my face!
Do not try your trickery on me!
Where is he? My son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
We had no children.
No, she was not as beautiful.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Ynyr!
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
...Office 2702.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
What's that man's name?
...Good... But what's special in him?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it! And did he pass your threshold or not?
No.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No?
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Take...
Why can't I have a bank account?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
No, no.
Do you need money?
That's what I later told myself! No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
It's better... You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf. I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...You moved too, didn't you?
You say it just to calm me!
Mathilda, listen!
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
May I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony. ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city... And never had another girlfriend...
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you? You met anyway?
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
...I don't know.
...Don't you like me?
I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.
Of course! I'm fine! I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up... I tried to get beautiful! Don't you like it?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out. You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
A little...
Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
I think.
...Shit!! We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...OK. I love you anyway.
When I say I love you.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...I'm going to kiss you.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
If you knew, Leon...! I killed one thousand in my head... And this never disturbed my sleep.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Why?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
No, you can't go out.
No.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
Yes.
...Because I feel it.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Come on, get down!
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
What?
Yes, yes...
OK.
Now, try a running guy.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Good! First shot!
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Who'll I aim at?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Rocket launcher.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters. When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot. Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss. A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5. You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
130... 140...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
OK, I'm fine.
Don't fear.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
...I got lost, Mister.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...No... he's my lover...
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...Composer.
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
How are you, Miss?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
+++$+++ Ten dollars... A month.
+++$+++ Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
+++$+++ You can't sit here like that.
Salute.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always. It's the only important thing in the world.
It's a specialty down there. It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Is he still alive?
...Who sent you?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn't the usual procedure...
But... He works for your same employer?
Messina.
These guys have no place. They change virtually everyday. And his name... It's a surname.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Do you recognize him?
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result. It's right this that makes me nervous, now. I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College. I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Why am I such an authority?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
For a walk. I don't know.
He probably just went somewhere.
I have to finish first.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice. Done. Finished. You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
What?
How serious is it?
You should definitely have children. They're really special.
Are you two planning kids?
Nothing's going to happen.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
No it's not.
I'll make it.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I have new dreams now.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty.
Don't wait by the phone. If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently. If I get any information, I'll call you.
How long does this... Mania last?
We're very sorry about that. Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law. He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
What would you like us to do?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again... Tell me something. Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her? Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
Are you a preacher?
Mine.
What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
What steps do we take now?
Can it kill me?
Twenty miles? I see.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
+++$+++ You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
+++$+++ You're feeling old and you want to start exercising. A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth. Don't feel embarrassed about it.
+++$+++ I've seen it before.
+++$+++ I know what you're getting at.
+++$+++ Yes -- you are.
+++$+++ I mean why the sudden voluntary visit -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
+++$+++ So what's the deal Maurice?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Go to sleep Ellen.
Yes.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year. I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Pacifica, California.
I know where my heaven is.
I think it's a different place for each person.
No it's not. He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He's never been there for me. I've always been alone.
He's plastered.
It'll make it.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
Don't be so sure.
You can change.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Yes.
I want children.
I've changed my mind.
Please tell me.
No. But I want to take a walk with you.
Walk with me?
Show me.
Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how... How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
Then why?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
Why do you polish it?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that.
Yes.
You don't think I love you?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
What it is -- is the truth.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
The new store?
Ellen?
It's a special day isn't it?
Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day?
You thought I sent them?
Yes?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Doubts? About what?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Most certainly.
Why?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Pacifica, California.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.
Out of the car. He jumped out of the god damn car!
Shit! He jumped!
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
Hansen's whipped. Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
A marriage certificate? Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
This guy's not a murderer.
Not our problem.
Not our problem.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine. Not our problem. He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Nine.
That's me.
Who's telling this story?
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
You tell stories?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Yeah!
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
By car right?
This is the route approved by triple A. Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
What was that?
Damn baby, relax. I'm getting to it. From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, no. It's just that --
The Gazette's small huh?
This story is big huh?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help. But I'm not risking your life.
Don't do this.
I do.
I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Come on Mr. Parker.
Are they standing?
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well. The Crusader for social issues and all.
I missed you Kris.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
She never ate a slice.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles... And you know what Kris?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Why know?
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I told you.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
I always knew you had good instincts... Goodbye Kris. I'll see you when I get back.
California.
I'm walking there Kris.
When are you leaving?
Where?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Are you firing me?
This is a ghost town. Nothing ever happens.
I want to reach people. Nobody listens to me. This is my way to reach them.
What happened?
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
It has to be a full character's name.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett... Pride and Prejudice.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
... My father.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
I need your help.
Do you have a car, Steph?
What do your friends call you?
In a hospital.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Where did he go?
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
I don't have kids.
+++$+++ Is it a boy or a girl?
+++$+++ Good morning.
What's your shoe size?
What do you mean?
Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.
Hello.
+++$+++ This is my only chance to get a watch like that. It would mean a lot to me and my family. Please take it. It really isn't that much.
+++$+++ I really want that watch.
It's yours.
+++$+++ We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
+++$+++ If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Water?
Sparkling apple cider?
Coffee?
Orange soda?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
What do you want?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
You know I love you... yeah?
I wanted to see you...
There are limits.
Will you lighten up, please?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Let's stay for a while.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Can we just ignore it?
Can we just forget it?
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Be careful.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
I warned you... ...but I'm sorry.
We?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Oh, and what did you do?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I know that...
No?
Well... OK...
Why?
OK.
Sorry.
Of course.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
I do. I really do. OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
What?
Don't be silly?
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time. Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Sera you are crazy.
Me neither.
Sera...
What do you mean?
I don't know. I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
How long have I been here?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Very clever.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later. The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
I like hearing you talk. If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
This is the home of an angel.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Yes.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
What's up?
Don't run away.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
To death?
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
OK... whatever.
Do you want to fuck now?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Of course.
You were going to get my door.
I sometimes fade out.
I guess I do too.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
No -- S.E.R.A.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Hello.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new one.
How'd this happen?
What did they look like?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
A date. What, are you a hooker? What do you mean a date? I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
About ready for another drink?
Yuri... are you...
No.
It's me, Yuri.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Where have you been staying?
I am lonely, Yuri.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
You have been lonely?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
I have a 4.0.
That's right.
Who?
What?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
Are we done for today?
Go to hell.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
What alibi?
That's not what's important.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
What's going on?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
No!
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
It's so shameful...
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Sort of.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Because they got wet.
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her -- She didn't have your bone structure.
How many, would you say?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Where you got in the shower.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Did you hear a shot fired?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Huh?
Come again?
Who's askin'?
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
Yes, I am.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
About the alibi --
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Sit down.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
What are you talking about?
Why the hell not?
Did you get it?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Was she carrying a weapon?
What did you see when you entered the house?
+++$+++ Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
+++$+++ Uh -- both?
+++$+++ I'm sorry?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Why didn't you call me?
+++$+++ Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
+++$+++ Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
+++$+++ -- his life?
+++$+++ I think so...
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ Yes?
You can't go home!
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
I'm so happy for you!
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
You ready?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
Is she?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
That's terrible!
No!
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
After you went to all that trouble?
You can't even imagine.
Name?
Relation?
Licensed attorney or family member?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Yes, he is.
Yes, you are.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
You almost had me fooled.
Really?
You're kidding!
I know. He has it sent out.
Really? Thanks.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
You know her?
Not yet.
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Margot!
I will...
No way --
What?!
Power yoga?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Here. You're gonna need this.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
So?
Thank you. I love you, too.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Too demure?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Is he the only one?
So Friday at eight?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Up for a celebration dinner?
Oh, my God!
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Whoa -- Why?
Hey --
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
You really think I'm attractive?
Projecting joy is not my job.
I don't -- Do that stuff.
What the hell is that for?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
You're serious?
The what?
So?
And you know this for a fact?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
She's not!
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
How do you figure?
But maybe it is --
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
She's completely untrustworthy.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
I wasn't gonna --
Thanks again for your help!
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
You have Stromwell.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Where's Warner?
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
Really --
What?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Almost.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I don't know! I don't know anything any more! I just need to be by myself.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What happened?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
Of course, I do!
+++$+++ That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
+++$+++ His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? See you tomorrow!
I do.
I don't know --
I did?
+++$+++ Yes? Ms. Woods?
+++$+++ Why not?
I guess it'll have to...
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
In court. On opposing sides.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Thanks for the backup.
Pink ones.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
You look -- nice.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Now I am.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Good. Good.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
You got into Harvard Law?
You go where?
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
East coast people are different.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
No.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
That's not entirely --
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
I completely agree.
And I fully support that.
Of course.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
You're beautiful.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Where?
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Hovering?
Why do you say that?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney. Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
VANDERMARK +++$+++ I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
VANDERMARK +++$+++ So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
She's naked.
There he is!
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Why?!
Let's all go! Road trip!
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you. Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
It's not a Theta --
Where's the Rock?
Purely a precaution...
Nay. This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
+++$+++ Fool's magic.
+++$+++ Why so few?
+++$+++ You go to lady now?
+++$+++ More fun win battle?
+++$+++ We watch... good fun...
+++$+++ Birdies... pretty...
+++$+++ We go out, smash 'em now?
+++$+++ Dumb magic. Giant smash peewee.
+++$+++ What?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Yes. I feel that, too. Weakness is what is ugly.
Now I want to live forever. I've never felt so strong or happy.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust. I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Might we watch, too?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
What was that? Did you hear that?
You're a beast!
I don't expect you'd understand.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I see...
What will become of me then?
And then?
Oh, yes...
At the moment, very little. Your company at my table...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art. They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach. The pain remains constant.
Why should I kill you? A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Do it now!
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
I'd soon die.
Why have you brought me here?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Like some vile toadstool.
Protection?
Then why hide behind a mask? You are ashamed!
And you... are you not also afraid?
You... you're a beast!
God protect me.
You lie! You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Grotesque... monstrous...
But I'm hideous!
You are cruel! Your heartless jesting worse than torture! How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
What do you want with me?
No more listening! Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Oh no... Don't you understand?
I need your help. In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles. I --
It's terrible.
Then you'll understand my quest. An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn. The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter. Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
East of Mercia?
Cathay?
Well, er... no. I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
I didn't know... I --
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature. We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle. Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Who might these friends be?
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Honeythorn Gump, is it? I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Nay. It was lost. When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it. Said she'd marry me if I did.
By the pond. She was teasing me.
I was with the Princess.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
A good day for singing...
He'll not escape me.
Sapphire!
I could have struck off his head just now!
He's getting away! He was at my mercy!
Don't get too far!
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Ah, but you will. And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Patience, lad.
Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Sunlight.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Aye. Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
I don't... understand.
Can you save her?
The wound is mortal.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
It doesn't matter.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Fire away!
Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.
That's it!
There must be some way to get it up there.
That's it! The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
What magic have we on our side?
There isn't much time!
Water doesn't burn...
There aren't enough arrows.
Easily spoken...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Why not mine the damned walls?
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we? For all the dark magic protecting it.
The chill is worse this night.
No... but what choice have we?
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
I know the rogue, Jack. Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
Hold, Jack! Don't strike!
Wait, Jack.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Heading true north. We continue in that direction.
We'll find it.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Stay on your guard, Jack. The bug is enchanted surely.
Willful creature, that one...
It bodes evil.
There's the way, mates.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Make haste! We've a hard day's march ahead.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
We're not in a tournament, Gump. Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Stoutly spoke, lad. These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Very secretive, they are. Keep their feet covered up. Best if you don't mention it.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Ogg's footprints!
My God! Look!
Nice piece of work.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned. A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps. Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
That would be Devil's Needle. Last landmark I know in these woods.
Stealing his arms?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
What know you of fields of war?
Jack, don't!
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Blackheart?
Good plan that.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Beware.
I'm sure. It spoke to me.
Jenny Greenteeth said: "Follow the raven in her flight..."
We must follow that bird.
Track the demon to his lair.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Fine-looking army.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Aye! That too.
Tricks, is it? Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp! I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it?
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
Damn them!
Pregnant, is she?
What is it?
Shhhh!
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield. Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
By the grace of God.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
You do the praying. I've work ahead.
Knaves and robbers...
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
And who might that be?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
I know where to find it. Taking possession be another matter.
Bravely spoke. You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Time for a champion. Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Aye. Black Baron's mischief.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
Here now. Toss her this when you've the chance. Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass. She's terribly vain. Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
What do I do?
Are we here?
Will you lead me to her?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Jenny Greenteeth? Who's she?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Then, what's gone wrong? Why did it happen?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Big question that, lad. Why what?
He is afraid of enchantment! Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Generally known! What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Are ye afraid of me wine? Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk? Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all. And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...? If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
I fear she's lost.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Well spoke. True to the mark. And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
Damnation! Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters! You've bested me, Jack.
What!
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Didn't you now? Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk? Is me music not to your liking? Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
Dance, Jack! The night's but begun.
To be sure.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Dolt!
How're these?
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
They've fired the moat!
Very thrifty. Even got your arrow back.
Three cheers for our champion.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Screwball! Be quiet...! We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
No, no, no... this is different!
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Nay. Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Keep me belly full, Jack. Kill us another worm.
Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie?
I can't see a thing.
Pinching? Where?
Biting you?
What's the matter?
Lili... I love you!
But... I am a Green Man. I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
You're teasing still.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
And I... love you...
In the dark... where I join him...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
You've freed me, Jack...
They told me you were dead.
I thought you were dead... I --
What have I done?
Lili! No!
Do you wish it, Jack? Wish you this our wedding band?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Let it. Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Oh, la...
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...? Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
Its powers are strong.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
It happened so fast. He was hurt and ran away.
My own father...
I didn't know... I didn't... It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My father and the Baron.
I don't know. They've hurt the unicorn.
To fetch your napkin.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Tis a fair question. If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Are you honest?
They rival the angels of paradise.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet. True royalty approaches.
Shhh!
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
I'm not its master.
I'll go search for it.
What's the matter?
Be patient.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
Stop complaining.
All right. I'll show you something sacred.
Unicorn?
Blackheart. Aptly named.
Sport, indeed.
Or perchance...
I may have said perhaps...
Never.
If you like.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Grand champion, is it? And what great cause leads you to me?
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
You'll visit again?
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Dead, dead, dead.
She's dead!
As fair as me?
Is she fair, this princess?
Princess? I know of no princess.
Ask away, sweet man.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth. Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Couer de Noir! A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Why then, there thou hast. We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death? It is a time of mourning. This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
I like well your conceit, Jack. Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Well spoke, boy. You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
What's this now?
Heading north still?
You beware, Jack! You and your porridge-pot heart!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Why should I feel such pain? Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
You... you... you mortal you!
What shape I take matters not. Long you for another? I'll give you your heart's desire.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
And sweet?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Jest with me then.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
And am I not fair?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Fie! Don't speak of charms. I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Only that?
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk. Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
No fear of that now.
No need for bells, Jack. I'll nay enchant ye.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Courage, Jack.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Sorry, Jack.
Hello, Jack.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Where?
Master Jack! Master Jack! These woods are alive! They're alive!
Praise be to God.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
What's she doing?
What do we do now?
The fastest in the world.
You're with us in battle.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Oh, but I have.
Don't speak to me of dreams! I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
You've been inside?
Nay. Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there. Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Can you show us the way?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Lost?
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Is he a friend, then?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
We did a lot of the wiring too.
He was there and then he wasn't!
I'm not cheating! I'm not looking!
Marco!
When does George get to come see his house?
He's here. Check the bathroom.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Home after. Will you come in and say "hi"?
Since seventh grade.
Sam!
We can work.
I wanna be with you today.
I thought I might stop by.
I love red! That's my favorite color!
What color?
Who are you?
I don't think Dad wants you home.
I would have anyway.
Mom said I should.
Who are all these people?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh. And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
What are you doing up so early?
You'd better call and cancel.
And why was the alarm on?
What's wrong?
Here, honey!
I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam.
It's not what I was expecting.
My mother would die.
Did you feel anything?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.
He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
What's that?
Monday.
Nope.
Is that legal?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
No.
He seems lonely.
I'll survive.
What?
Where are you?!
He asked where you were! He wants you with him.
Not if what he left me was real.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
What?
Are you afraid of heights?
Okay. I guess.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality. I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
You're off, you know? You're way, way off.
You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
I'm not gay.
What are you talking about?
It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
What's the point of this?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Why are you so uptight?
We're not gonna do anything.
I'm coming in.
I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me.
This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
I'm okay.
Huh?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie?
Why?
Really?
Yeah.
No. That's okay.
I might not stay, anyway.
I can't even take a shower here.
He's a freak.
He jumped into the ocean.
I don't know.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Where to?
What are you doing here?
Hi.
No.
He won't leave my room.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's got a standing invitation.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
George just never really...aimed that high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun. It was always like you were frightened. Quiet and boring.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone?
Are you guys' friends?
It could have been a squirt gun.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
This is such a street of whiners.
That would take weeks.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
Mr. Stevens. One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I hate to ask about a window.
A sink?
And if I enclosed it?
A violation?
I've been dreading you.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me.
I've got one favor to ask.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
What are you talking about? You love your job.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.
Forty.
Oh.
Maybe...?
I've been here twenty years.
I'm not.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Right...she married...what was he?
How's your wife?
how much weight have you lost?
What are you on?
Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.
Is Alyssa here?
You're here early today.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Thanks for the shower.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
I didn't recognize you!
Sam?
She didn't really say.
She's out with a friend.
Where are you? You're driving me crazy, waiting like this. I want you in me now!
And you thought they might be under her dress?
My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
He escaped. He's going back in.
You don't know what the deal is. There is no fucking deal.
I never said anything. I haven't done anything.
I'll ask.
I don't know.
Here.
Well, congratulations! You fucking pulled it off!
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here? Trying to get me to like you.
You lied to me!
Yes.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what? Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain. And you're going through them quick.
She seemed upset.
You look better than ever.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
After everything.
I loved him too much.
Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
To hide a black eye.
I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it.
Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Getting high, I guess.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I'm telling you now.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
He's got nothing to do with me.
What do you know about me?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
Nothing.
What I'm not.
How do you become something you're not?
I like how it feels not to feel.
I took some of your Vicodin.
Hi, Alyssa.
We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
Don't. I don't want it.
You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me.
I won't ever hit you. I don't want you smaller. I want you to be happy. You're not. Not here with me. Not home with your mother. Not up in Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere. You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes. In your sleep. In your answer to everything. You're barely alive.
The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
No.
You can't make me do a thing.
You're too fucking late.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid. You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
Did you got through my pants?
Where is it?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
When are you going to be back?
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I can promise you complete privacy.
I don't beg.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I'm not doing it!
No one would blame me if I left!
You'll have money when you work.
I don't know.
You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
Why?
No you don't.
Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired of your attitude.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I warned you yesterday.
Goodnight.
I almost saw Catalina.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father. Think of it as a family tradition.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam. I won't ever hit you. This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. Now.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. And there's no make-up at my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You don't have a choice.
You have everything?
I'll get your bag.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
No I'm not!
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
Why would you be there?
To check up on me?
Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. Six years. I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I haven't been touched in years.
I can die trying.
Stage four pancreatic cancer. They haven't even pretended to offer treatment. You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I'd build a house.
Good for you.
I don't let him. He just loves to.
I want you to find someone for me.
I need you to do me a favor.
I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave?
Check the permits. It was built as a guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I know there's an explanation.
At least your father tried, George.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot. I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
I aimed high.
She's a little sad, is all.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Oh. Sorry.
Three.
Not a perfect day.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
It's not my back that's killing me.
So could I.
What?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
Peter left me yesterday.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Is your back still killing you?
I need to know.
If I weren't married?
I'm married.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
You've never said that before.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I thought we were helping.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't! So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George. I'll stop coming. But it won't be because of Peter. It'll be because you asked me to stop. Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore. I'd hate to have them bored.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I smiled at him.
This was my very first slow dance.
I think so.
You're a good mother.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
You brought your kids?
Where's Sam?
Do you need anything? I'll go to the pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
With your hands or your tongue?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Oh...with his ear infection!
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Finished or unfinished?
It's not breakfast yet.
What is it?
You head was pressed against my chest. I could feel your heart racing. And I remember I kissed your hair.
Do you remember?
What have you been before today?
Sam's favorite.
The first and the last.
I was here six years. And I only hated two.
I used to live here.
It makes me sad.
We're fine. Turkey sandwiches.
George --
I did say he could go.
No. I was going to let you do that.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I drove over and you were gone.
What was I supposed to do? When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
Hey, hey!
I want him with me.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor.
The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive.
Not for the weekend. For the summer.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
When's school over?
The garage.
I love those doors.
Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
I was parked in day parking.
I need to talk to you.
But you can't call me while you think?
What did you do with your dog?
Where have you been for a week?!
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today.
Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? I don't know anything, anymore!
He never answers.
What are you doing?
Where is he?
You let him pierce his nose?
Ring the bell before you try the door.
I could use the money.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen. I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing. She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Don't even...I'm there.
You got the money?
Nothing.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Been thinking?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
What the fuck?
What are you talking about?
He said he heard hammering.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Where are the kids?
That's the problem.
Despite you.
You never really trusted me.
What are you doing home?
I know.
So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
You can't go because of Sam?
Good. That was the plan. We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
What?
Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
Sooner than the Fall.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
We should take a vacation.
I'd be you.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Should I?
I'll make you something.
We've eaten.
His father is a man.
Do you like red?
Either do you.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Take it off.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Okay.
No.
Why?
It's not ours. It's George's.
Hey.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for. Maybe it's what I want.
This is what he wants.
Yeah.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
The door was open.
Can you stay for dinner?
I locked the door! Get out! I locked the door! Get out!
What are you doing in my room?
Dad's home, already?
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Would you stop being ridiculous? Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Adam, that's not true!
I brought a few of my own.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
All day again?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
What did you say?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
+++$+++ A night in the hole?
+++$+++ Nigger.
+++$+++ Nagger?
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
And the baby?
Is Mae Rose okay?
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Sharp.
Yeah...
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
No, but...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Want me to come back some other time?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Married?
Why not?
She's alright, isn't she?
Yeah.
Sure, boss.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Goodnight, Claude.
I'll be right back.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Yes, boss.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
Comfortable?
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
But I'm having a good time...
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
Engagement ring!
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
He looks like he can take care of himself.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink? Two bourbons.
Can't you remember your own name?
That's because I've never been here before.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
So?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Gimme that damn thing.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Why the hell not?
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
I said you're soft.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
You sure it was him?
Don't make me take them away from you.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Back to New York for starters.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
Don't touch that car.
Goodnight, Ray.
I'm not working on a plan.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
What?!
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
That's the way it is.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Make 'em throw strikes.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Let me see that.
Whatever.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Him?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
I'm stuck!
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
You drew this?!
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
What'd you say?
Does that mean I'm in?
No.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
You still got that map?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What's up, Ray?
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Forget it.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
So?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit. How 'bout him down there?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
This fork is filthy.
So?
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
What ain't there?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
He's dead.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
He even got my daddy's watch.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
So you made a generous contribution.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
Still got that ten dollars?
Here I am.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
What gave you that idea?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Alright. You want some pie?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
What'd you say?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Oooh...
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
You need collateral.
Uh-huh.
That's right, a loan officer.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
No, tell me what's so funny.
What?
That's some long green.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Here, this belongs to you. It was empty when I found it.
You went to Monroe?
Claude Banks.
I don't think so.
I try to moisturize regularly.
'Preciate it. Claude.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
I'm all right.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Made just for you, Cookie.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
You killed Santa Claus?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
+++$+++ You heard what the man said! Move it!
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
+++$+++ Movin' it out, boss.
+++$+++ All in, boss!
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
+++$+++ Judge gave 'em the long ride.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
+++$+++ State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
+++$+++ Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your... metropolitan assets!
+++$+++ Why ain't that pick swinging?
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Hey, Ray...
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
They gave me life, mama.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
I can't take that, mama.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
What are you doing here, mama?
Mama?
+++$+++ You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
+++$+++ Wait for the firemen!
+++$+++ Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
+++$+++ Is everyone here?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
What's going on here?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
I prefer bourbon.
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Something like that, yes.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
+++$+++ Who?
+++$+++ Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
+++$+++ Appreciate it.
+++$+++ Jenny?
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's a long story...
Me? Willie Long.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Blacks welcome there?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Where'd you get this?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Absolutely not.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
You shouldn't have come here.
Don't do it!
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
You mother...
All right. Let me out.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
...their damned souls will be ours.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
What do you think about... Earth?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
It's just such a slap in the face.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Uh. No it won't?
And give you a good buzz.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
She goes to Parson's, right?
All these good people have totally been led astray.
I'll call her later.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
What is it?
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Yeah, you do...
She's so nice.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Angels don't get any older, son.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Try an angel.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Where is he? He's late.
Did you just talk?
What's Nicky doing down there?
This is baloney!
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I didn't murder anybody
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Release the evil?
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
So far, so good. Now what?
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Oh. Sorry.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Everything's fine, pop.
Now you're talking.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
DEMON +++$+++ Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
DEMON +++$+++ Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Yes, Jimmy.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
You came through, Nicky.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Son, just do your best.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
How bad?
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
I was just playing with you.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
I mean... tough break.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Now everybody sit down.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Bus?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Thanks.
Hey.
Coulda been much worse.
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Boogerland!
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
I know, your wickedness.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
DEMON +++$+++ You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
You're not saying it's up to me?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
DEMON +++$+++ Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
DEMON +++$+++ Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Oh, would you grow up.
No.
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
This don't look good.
Schnapps...
Looking for the chief.
You sure you're down with this?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Look who's back from the dead.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Should we wake him up?
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
'Bout time...
See ya, fellas.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Come on. One more time.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Which way did he go?
+++$+++ Yes, great movie...
+++$+++ You keep a bat under your seat?
+++$+++ You followed him?
+++$+++ Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
I'll just go to Heaven.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Good idea... kill me.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Please. You got to.
You got the wrong window again, man.
Adrian?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
You smell like coconuts.
I love you.
Do me.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Nicky!
Don't do it.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal.
We're going to Jersey?
Can we go fly over Central Park?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
..."The Devil?"...
Yes...
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
I think I'm floating.
No.
Valerie?
What were you thinking coming here?
Hey.
What was that?
What?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Basically, yeah.
Good. I was concerned.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
School?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
The South.
You think I'm a tourist?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
That just hurt a lot.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
A black guy?
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Why is that funny?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
I don't know?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
Hey...
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they... ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
We're ready.
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How do you want us?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
You're a beautiful pair.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Is that the wind? Not yet... You must hear my birds sing.
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
From? From? From?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Anything to eat?
Your turn.
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken? I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either. No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
I designed it myself. What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Your own work?
Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Why did you do that???!!!
Why did you do that??!!
It has nothing to do with you.
At Carousel tonight?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
Of course.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
What the hell took you so long?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Yes. But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I'm in my party mood.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than -- come on, Sandman.
Well... you can't have them all.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.
I never even visited Nursery before tonight. When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Why?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect. I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand... So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
I'm very smart.
Here.
I'm Mary 2.
Of course. I don't know where... I just took them for granted. It's our only chance.
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Beloved wife...
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Yes. You and I, Jessica.
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
To what?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
It could be...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
Then the answer's yes...
...But I still have the choice...?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
What does it mean?
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through... Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
Don't ever let go.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Don't!
I hate outside! I hate it!
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
For us.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I'm afraid.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything... ...to eat, of course.
It's the only way.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you. Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
You think Sandmen will? There's no other way for me,
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...
Because he's my friend -- and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Are you taking me to them?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
But what is this -- why?
Let's see -- how long has it been?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Uh-uh.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman: We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
They're like beasts. Wild.
I'd rather be with you.
You're not going, are you?
We're coming to Arcade. Shall we Relive together?
Of course --
I wish I knew what you think I know.
I wish I could help you.
What're you going to do?
Are you here to help me?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Please? What friends?
I don't..
And then you killed him, right?
Where did you get that?
It's different now. Help me.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
You know something.
I'm going to run.
All right.
You know.
Then it's still no.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Here I am. Shall I come in?
You could have called me yourself.
K.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. Want to try?
Are you a 5 or a 6?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm afraid to tell you.
Not about that.
How a Sandman lives.
Curious.
I changed my mind.
I thought I had to do something.
No.
No.
Jessica.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
He was killed.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
No.
No. Just no.
Please... No.
+++$+++ Oh, my...
+++$+++ Where are you going?
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
At least it's over...
+++$+++ They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
+++$+++ We'll have to bury him.
What people?
What belongs to the people?
No.
I don't know.
+++$+++ Mother and Father said so... you know?
+++$+++ Yes...
+++$+++ Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three. "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES." An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
+++$+++ Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Hello.
+++$+++ Oh my... I'll try.
+++$+++ Yes...
+++$+++ Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
+++$+++ Oh, yes... I think...
+++$+++ My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
+++$+++ That's better than gold when it's cold.
+++$+++ Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
More... many more.
+++$+++ Alive?
+++$+++ What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
+++$+++ All right.
+++$+++ Are you ready to put him in?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
+++$+++ It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat. "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
+++$+++ They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Where are they?
+++$+++ My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
+++$+++ But there may be a few around somewhere.
+++$+++ Gracious... no.
+++$+++ I have always been here...
+++$+++ Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
+++$+++ For as long as I can remember.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica. Can you do it? Will you?
Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Well? How do you like it?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Pete... You okay?
What?
Pile in.
What's happenin'?
You want somethin'?
Listen.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Good... You up for a drive?
You're not contagious are you?
Why not?
Why not?
What do you mean by that?
Yes, I thought my wife...
This is our bedroom.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
No.
Do you own a video camera?
What is?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
You know what I think?
Ours, Ed.
What a fuckin' job.
You recognize that guy?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
As best we can.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Right... This just glided along.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Alice?
We killed him.
Alice, I...
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Are you my man?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else... To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Set.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
So, should I call Andy?
You liked it.
In pornos?
How'd it happen, Alice?
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pornos.
What's he do?
What deal?
You like it?
Have you partied with him?
We should stop seeing each other.
So what do we do?
Are you positive he knows?
Okay.
Hello.
Me, too.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I can't see you tonight.
It's me...
Okay, baby.
Can I call you?
I want more.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I don't know.
Yeah, I remember.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Yes, I believe so.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Sure.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Please tell me.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Never saw him before in my life.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yeah? what did they want?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Sit down.
Sit down a minute.
Do ya good.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later. For now, he's free to leave.
No.
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
His condition? What do you mean?
The wife killer?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
No... Here he comes.
Out in back.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
We'll get a tail put on him.
What's the word on the street?
+++$+++ Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
+++$+++ I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
+++$+++ He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
+++$+++ He's in the infirmary, being examined.
+++$+++ I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
+++$+++ Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
+++$+++ Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
+++$+++ I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
+++$+++ No, sir, it's not.
+++$+++ I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Pete, what happened to you?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. Mel, let's get Peter in here.
He didn't come home.
When he went to work, right.
I wouldn't know how.
Who is it?
We know that.
What's the matter?
Do you remember?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
A headache?
+++$+++ Not even close.
+++$+++ He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
+++$+++ I don't know yet.
+++$+++ FUCKIN' "A".
+++$+++ SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR. CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
+++$+++ DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
I... I didn't say anything...
The first night... Not the last two.
Tone deaf.
What's your axe?
There's no other bedroom?
That's it.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
What is it?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
No, no. I want to go in.
My... My head.
+++$+++ Alice who?
That's absurd.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No... of course not.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
I told you to stay in the car!
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
But...
Just a minute.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Why would anyone do something like this?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What was that?!!!
What the hell is going on?!
We will.
So?
We've got to call the police.
Don't you want to watch it?
What's that? Another tape?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
I had a dream about you last night...
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Called? When?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
What night?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Maybe.
No, nothing.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
A videotape.
Wake me up when you get home.
I like to laugh, Fred.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
The heart, I guess.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
+++$+++ That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
+++$+++ You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
Okay.
Mr. Eddy?
Who is this?
Hello.
What?
+++$+++ I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
+++$+++ How ya doin', Pete?
It'll be ready.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
+++$+++ You will.
+++$+++ Suit yourself, champ.
+++$+++ Yeah. Give ya a boner.
+++$+++ You like pornos?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
I can see that.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
+++$+++ All right!
+++$+++ It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
+++$+++ I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
+++$+++ I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
+++$+++ Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that.
+++$+++ What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
What's goin' on?
We just killed a couple of people...
At your house. Don't you remember?
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Go home, Sheila.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Hey... Sheila.
Sheila...
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
I didn't know you cared.
I was?
Where'd you come from?
Why don't you like me?
I don't know.
What do you want?
Sheila?!
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
No... I told you.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You still care about me?
Whatiya mean?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
What night?
I don't know.
Sorry... I...
Sure.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Yeah.
I missed you.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Yes, sir.
All of it?
+++$+++ Oh, read it!
Yes.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Thank you.
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well. Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
In a quandary.
Come on, Lovey.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Certainly not!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Yeah. You know.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Okay, Lovey.
Just call me Barney.
Sounds like a stall to me.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Uh-huh. Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.
No kidding?
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Yes!
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is— What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Oh, really?
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
It certainly is.
That's ridiculous.
Why, of course. Yes.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
I see.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning, Lovey.
Don't call me brother.
Yes, it just shows— I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Uh-huh.
Sorry.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Uh-huh.
Well, what do you know about that!
Oh, I see.
A what?
Fossils, huh?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it. Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang. So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Huh?
Think of it! In times like these.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time. Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Chalmers Bryant!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
What are we going to do?
Well, that's that, I guess.
Charming chap.
If you want me to!
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Why, you look beautiful.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you. How about you?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
You mean you don't want to go?
Right this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Hey - look!
Cave, eh? Where?
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
It's weird. Chang, how old are you?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Suppose she should leave it?
Amazing! She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Yes, charming.
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
The only one.
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
You're startled?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Centuries.
They were.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Oh, good heavens, no!
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including— —the excess of virtue itself.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
Who, for instance?
So there are others?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Thank you.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
And mine's Conway.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Please let me help you.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Thank you.
Then it's done.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Splendid!
Now, what would you like to do?
Why, no.
Oh, I'm so glad.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Yes.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
No.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
How can we get in touch with them?
Oh, dear.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Pardon me—
Hey!
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
I thought so! He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy. Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him! Oh George, you must take me with you!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
+++$+++ Sit down, my son. You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
+++$+++ What is it, my son?
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Mine?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now, child.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on. Come on.
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
What was that?
Come on! We're wasting time!
What about the others?
The clothes?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway. I found out a lot of things last night. I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Why not?
She's going with me.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
I'd go mad!
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates? I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
What else can I think after a tale like that? Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
Stay here?! What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here. I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
What about the porters?
Let me up! Let me up!
George, come back!
George, what do you think you're doing?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Nothing about the porters yet?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Uh-huh.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Well - I mean—
Did I say "if"?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
I don't know.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything. I think I'm going to like it here.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Hello, George. Cigarette?
What's it mean?
Yes.
What is it?
He's dead.
What is it? Has he fainted?
Oh George, come on.
What are these people?
George, what are you going to do?
Oh, stop it!
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries? You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?" So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants— —and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory! People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means. Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Just what I needed too.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Bob, these are all that are left.
All right, go ahead! We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Yes.
Yes.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us! George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
In for what?
Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?
What if he refuses?
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
Where were you hiding?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Forgiven. You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
Why?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Why, mother?
I was just going to.
Why?
Struggling, why?
Why?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
You see, it's not a dream.
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm so glad.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
What is?
I'm thirty.
Yes, I know.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
That was easy. I read your books.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
hope you'll forgive me for—
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
You'll wait till you rot!
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
How about you? Do you want to go?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
Why, he's speaking English.
What is it?
What do you want him to do?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Thank you.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you. Please . . .
I'll make some for you! You will come today?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
EXCUSE ME–
And if I say yes?
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
I gotta be honest about something.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
You got smeared.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
...touch that.
So... this door. It's... not an exit... ?
Yes. That's true. Actually, at this point, I just want A job. Wait. What do you mean... yet?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Wait. Uh-- sir. Please. Anyway. Hook-head-guy. I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain. I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Well, I dunno. I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Uh... yes. Apparently I did, air.
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about your choice of targets.
The hell happened?
It'll make sense later?
So... wait. You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Yes, sir.
What happens if I say no?
Mrs. Edelson?
You think we're nuts.
Sir. I thought those records were sealed.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
They don't?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
You do?
Cowan. Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Look. I don't know why. I could guess, however. Maybe it's your attitude. Or that you're not even close to a team player. Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Well this didn't.
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Dee. God damn it. I told you to go home.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years. We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Yup. Sure is.
Don't worry about it.
Grab the coffee, will ya? I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
I wasn't scared...
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Kay, I'm sorry...
What? I thought you just--
Mikey. Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me. Mikey. I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey Gimme the 140.
I'd go with number three.
You heard me. You two, especially.
Underground gas vein. Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
+++$+++ Why? What are you gonna do?
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
+++$+++ What? Who the hell are you?
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
After I got the shit beat out of me!
You were saying?
Do IT! SHOOT HIM!
in case I need it?
Wow... this one's cool. And it looks just like a shotgun.
Do his job.
I'd double it and add 20.
All of it?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
For how long?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing. That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury. Did it leave when everything else left?
That's my point. For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things. He said our enemy in already here. Well maybe it is. Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
I know you don't trust him. You don't trust anybody--
Kay. All I'm saying--
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Yes. Well, in his own mind, yeah. What if, from his point of view, he is?
Hang on. There's gotta be something on this guy. Did you contact the Alliance? Do they have anything?
You know something? I actually never think of that. I gotta get some coffee.
Oh, yeah? Fill us in, why don't you.
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Where's it coming? Where's he landing?
Jesus Christ...
Jesus...
Ernie Goose? Cynthia?
You think that's what's-happening?
The radio show?
What's going on, Kay?
Looks like a train ticket.
And what's this ... ?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Gee. You really think?
There's a god damn good reason.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid. They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
A what?
I guess it's simple, huh? They're either gone... or dead.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife. All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Let's check am out.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD. Jay winces.
Um-- Kay?
Why? Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun. I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Well, one thing's for sure. You could certainly lighten up.
Ha ha. No, really.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
I think you're too used to it. If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
I know, I know. I read the manual. No attachments. We work alone. Blah. blah.
Hey, I was workin' her. I was workin' my thing.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot. And what if I wanted to see her again? I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I'm just saying it was cold. I think she kind of liked me.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
This is a college? I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
It's the way we do it. The way we've always done it.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa. I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
So... lemme get this straight. We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets. We got information no one else in the world is privy to. And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
Right.
I understand. Hey, it works for the Hasids, right? No one recognizes them.
Oh. Right. I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way. Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space. Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Sure.
Yeah. His dream and our worst nightmare.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
They respond to fear, right?
Are you sure you don't?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Out of focus?
Actually... I don't know.
What do we do? Lean into it.
So... how did they get here?
When?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What is it?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
I don't think so. I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe. But you... Exterminator, I'd understand. But entopolgist? No way.
It's hard to find. It's an old civil war cemetery. Nobody ever goes there. So... what is it you say you do?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Exactly. I very much enjoy that.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Oh, yeah, well, you know. I'm a big fan. I've read all your work.
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Actually, they disgust me. But that's what I love about them. Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
You're not taking me in!
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
You figured what?
Maybe you need a closer look.
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack. Recognize this?
Goodwill...
Not bad. Briliiant, actually. You come unarmed, and alone. Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Come on now. People are smart.
How could it not?
What are you talking about, it's coming? What's coming?
Try seven. From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident. You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?
Oh yeah? Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to? You know how many rules you've just broken?
I don't believe you, Mikey. And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Did he say where?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
I know what this is. Zed, you in?
Nothing at all? Now? Last month? Anything in the last few years?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
+++$+++ We've got about eight or nine prospects I want you look--
This guy. Where was he?
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Found it.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Which way?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau. We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
I mean, I dunno. I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability. But never like this.
This it?
We're from Scientific American. We read about your discovery. We'd like to take a look.
How'd you know?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates? Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Yeah? What's up?
Actually, I don't know...
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Where's he making his big speech?
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
And they're buying it?
I'm getting a trajectory...
They're gone.
Hard to tell. I hope not.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
What about the other agents? Ella? Tee?
What the hell is going on?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
So whattya say, kid? You in or out?
Fine. Good.
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN. Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup. We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
A good question. And a simple answer. No more hunger. No more smog. No more overpopulation. No more war.
Why, you might ask? Because you're ready. Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
RUN!
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
She grew up.
The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Why?
Someplace safe.
But you still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did.
Please, I want to go back...
Anderton --
What is it?
I have to find out what happened to my life. Agatha. I'm not going to kill the man. I don't even know him.
I can't. I have to know.
He's here.
Agatha...
He'll turn around.
Do it. Right here. On the ground.
Drop some money.
Can you see the balloon man?
Agatha...
Who?
What?
What?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information. I need to know how to get it. Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is? Can you tell me if --
Wally!
John? What is it?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
About who?
Think, John. Why would they set you up?
Found? Where?
Then who was he?
-- go blind. I know.
+++$+++ Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs. But whatever you do, don't scratch.
+++$+++ I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
+++$+++ It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
How do I find the --
+++$+++ How can I do what I do now? Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
+++$+++ And put them out. Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we? The future is much more interesting than the past. Don't you think?
+++$+++ They were performance pieces.
+++$+++ Yes, you did.
+++$+++ Baltimore. Eastside. Solomon P. Eddie M.D. I was a plastic surgeon.
+++$+++ Oh, yes.
+++$+++ You don't remember me, do you?
It's all I could safely move.
+++$+++ Whatever you say, John.
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ And replace them with new ones.
+++$+++ Anesthesia. Try to relax, John. I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes. Completely.
+++$+++ You do understand I can't just give you new irises. The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear...
+++$+++ Don't worry. I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection. Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
Lara --
So she cleaned up. Where is she now?
Just tell me about the intended victim. This Anne Lively...
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but... ... I can't pull up any data from the female. Probably just a glitch.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Why's he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
... Graveyard shift.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
That's right. It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
That's an old one. One of our first.
Victim's a white female.
Kill type?
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
You the sentry?
No doubt.
Beauty? The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it. You've created a world without murder. So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Everybody runs.
I'm not getting halo'd.
John. Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
We're years from that. John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Then come to my house. We'll talk --
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
And who the hell is that?
Stop. Just wait. Who's the victim?
Justice already knows. Talk to me, John. Tell me what's happening?
No? How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
I go running down there.
I'm fine.
What?
He's not. He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
So give him a tour. He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there. And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
Tuck in your shirt.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him. If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Lamar, I'm sorry. I don't know what --
Hang on, Lamar --
Uh-huh...
The nation votes this week...
Tell me not to worry, John.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Don't run, Chief. You know we'll catch you. You trained us.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here. We never touch anything.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Uh, sir...
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Seventeen minutes.
Sure, Chief. I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Confirm with trig and image.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Nope. Somebody's thinking about this one.
We're in motion on something.
Go back to work. All of you.
Uh-huh. Jad?
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
What?
Go ahead.
Yeah? So?
Georgetown.
No maglev system.
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Got him in the Foxhall. 4421 Gainsborough.
We can't grab it...
We need confirmation on the time frame. Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
You gonna tell on me?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
I agree. The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human. It always is. Thank you for the tour, Wally.
Flaws.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway. The power's always been with the priests. Even if they had to invent the oracle.
But you call this room the "temple".
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
There's no question. You don't have any.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
To Hineman?
It was Iris Hineman. She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
Yes.
Because it was going to fall.
Yes, it is.
You mind if I tag along?
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Just go to the beginning!
Are these all of her previsions?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Wally, listen to me...
To you? I don't think so... What'd she say?
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She grabbed you? Impossible. The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
They're not in any pain. We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
I can't touch you! And John, you can't be in here! You'll confuse them!
Rufus, play it back...
What happened? Where's the rest?
Stop --
They don't belong to anybody.
So now I need you to hack into her.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
She's got information inside of her. I need you to get it out.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
That's right.
Rufus. She's a precog.
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here. For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Detective. Nice of you to come down here. Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now. Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Sean, wait...
Who are you?
I wanted to.
I was looking for you...
I forgive you...
I forgive you.
Sean --
Oh, Sean --
You're alive?
What the hell.
It's a little late for that.
Sean -- you're not real.
Come on!
Okay... now let me time you.
Four. Wow. What a big boy. I love you, Sean.
I won!
I scored a goal!
You're not gonna kill me...
Tell me!
Who made you do this?
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
What about the picture --
I don't know -- I never saw his face. All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere. Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Look, I've put my family through enough misery. You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
You're supposed to kill me. He said you would.
The precogs were wrong.
No.
NO!
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
He's alive?
His name was Sean. Six years ago. Francis pool.
Do you know who I am?
Six years ago. Baltimore. You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Which one is that?
How do I even know which one has it?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime. They'll pick me up...
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
If... you have one.
Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it.
The safest place of all.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time. I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You shouldn't. You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself. Not the young federal agent who wants your job. Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report.
Hold that thought.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow. Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Do you? Really?
The system would collapse.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime. Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility. After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt? It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way. But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
And, yet, a chain of events has started. A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
So many of them... despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them. It doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them. He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things. Precrime. The precogs. You.
It began as play. A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right. And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same. They were all about murder. And the murders were all happening.
You're talking about the precogs...
Heal who?
You don't seem all that proud.
What's so funny?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
I'm... not... a... killer.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Something wrong?
Then how did he --
Oh, God, what did you do?
John?
All right. Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
I understand.
Sean --
He also said Crow was a fake.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here. This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
It's insanity around here.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years. I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
This is all my fault.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
How did you get this?
Congratulations, sir.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
The guy from USA Today is here.
What?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
So there is a way to fool the system?
Precog Deja Vu...
By fooling the system. All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
I did find it. It was inside of Agatha all this time. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I don't understand --
Not quite.
Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel. Agatha's stream was missing. Now this one is from the cyberparlor. Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
Wait, just a second...
Where are you?
What?
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
He's my subordinate!
None of your damn business.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
The Mets. John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Get the hell outta here. You sick bastard.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Right here.
I wanna kill my boss.
None. This was arranged.
I worked homicide before I went federal. This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence". Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
I don't know, why?
No. He can't...
He's trying to prove his innocence.
We can stop him.
Two?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket. There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Yes, I know.
What?!
Don't worry. I'll bring him in unharmed.
Because of the nature of murder. "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood. And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Crime of passion. No premeditation. They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one. We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Can't they shut that off?
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
John Anderton was my friend!
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
I forgot my glasses.
Sure. Raincheck.
Ah. That must be why you look so nice.
We could have lunch together.
What about your meeting?
The man across the street. I've seen him before...
He looks familiar.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To what? Trap him?
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave.
Not very well, I'm sure. I'd probably start doping myself. Or maybe I'd...
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies. This is all in your statement, Lara...
What was it then?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
But John was with him at the pool?
You mean after he lost your son.
Have you been there recently?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
Thank you. He hasn't tried to contact you?
He's not here now, is he?
Just sugar then. You and John ever come here?
Cream and sugar.
I like it.
This your work?
My name is Danny Witwer. I'm --
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males. But the female, she's the key. She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent. The one who takes care of the other two.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
But there's still the other two.
What does he want with a precog?
Tell me how all this works.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
What are you talking about?
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
No thank you.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
You're Bobby, right?
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
It's on West Broadway.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Women?
As far as...?
Thank you, sir.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
All the suites are about the same.
What, sir?
Thank you very much, sir.
Are you sure?
Not on me, sir.
I can take you down there.
Yes, sir.
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
What's 'incidentals?'
Somebody's getting comfortable.
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
We're in Fashion.
No.
Manhattan.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh no. What is it this time.
I know.
He's great, right. Is he great?
Should I fuck him?
Is he cute?
Holy shit.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
What the fuck was that about?
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
No.
I don't know.
Uncle Bobby?
Hello.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
He's not doing it.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
I want you to take her with you.
Take her.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I never promised you anything.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Max offered to stake me.
I'll support you.
I want you to quit.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Yeah? You sure?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
I'm ready.
Who's watching the baby?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Where were you?
I don't get it.
+++$+++ Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
+++$+++ Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
+++$+++ Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
There's no touching.
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
This is it.
That it?
How so?
Where's Ricky?
Where we going?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Heard of them.
Ruiz tied in out there?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Yeah?
No.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Yeah.
What's that?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Yeah. Where is he?
Excuse --
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Yeah.
What's up? Jess ready?
Yeah, sure.
5-5-1.
Draw.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Take a few days --
Yes. Goodbye.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
You want --
Yes.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You vouch for him?
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop. Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I didn't say that.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
A million. Easy.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
You bet the ponies?
You like the ponies?
Where's the drop?
Tom, the Welsh dude --
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Nah, man...
Good morning.
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Taken care of?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Understand me?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Depends what night.
Spa?
I can wait around if you want.
No. Just the cross streets.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Where is the Soho Grand?
Nah.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
What's that?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
+++$+++ I be off in a minute. Say again...?
+++$+++ So's this. Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
+++$+++ I'm on the phone.
+++$+++ Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Any time, bro.
Sorry, man, but...
Can you check?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
We're with Ruiz.
No. I'll wait here.
Dude, we were practically made...
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy. Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Three and a half hours?
So what do we do?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
It's gonna be fine.
I'm sorry...
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Calm down.
What about it?
You did?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Eighty five.
Eighty.
No.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Float me a hundred bucks.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
Wanna bet?
All the more reason.
I'm pretty sure we do.
We need guns.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
The penguin house.
Let's check out the penguins.
Let's do it.
Nothing, man.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
C'mon, man...
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
What are you doing.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
We're getting whacked.
Where?
What's up?
She was jonesing for me.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English.
What the fuck's going on?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Fine.
You got that right.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Back in.
Fuck this.
You too?
About what?
So we're working?
You would think.
Like I said, I don't know.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
What did I 'get?'
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
I don't know.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
You got something to say --
What the fuck is that supposed --
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Motherfucker...
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
This is bullshit, man.
So they said more than the address.
How'd they know who you were?
Nothing else.
They didn't say an address?
What exactly did they say?
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
What are you doing?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Oh really. Why's that?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Great. On my fucking room.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
How much was it?
How much is it?
C'mon, man...
Who you calling?
You sure?
No. Look. There.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Nah, don't bother --
What's the movie?
Pretty nice.
To keep?
She really liked the kitchen.
Right here's fine.
I don't know.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Shhh... Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there. You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I like it.
I like it.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
We look good this year.
Sorry coach.
You wanna go right now?
Bullshit...
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
He didn't say we need guns.
We don't need guns.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
Shhh...
Then why do you try to get in?
I thought you hate that club.
Bye.
I will.
I got no idea.
I know the number.
Yeah. I know the number.
I'll page you.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Don't be shitty.
Don't be shitty.
It's not losing record.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So?
What are you saying?
What about boxing?
Fuck...
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Hey, boys.
I want to leave right now.
You want to come splash around.
Yeah. I want it.
Where's the surprise?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Kinda. Yeah.
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
He's on the list.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
What?
You see a Ricky Slade?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
The line's over there.
Cool.
You look good, man.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
What's up, man.
+++$+++ I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
+++$+++ Excuse me.
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ Yes. Would you care for another one?
+++$+++ Yes?
The videos.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Ugh...
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Watch it...
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Stop.
See you later.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Don't drag my ass into this --
It means you got a gun?
You strapped?
How do you know it's not drugs?
Where's Spa.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Here they are, then.
No, really, mate?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
You want another drink?
No shit?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Word.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa. Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Different.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
No. What is it?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
You'll love it.
You're from LA, right?
The Soho Grand?
Soho Grand, right?
You rode?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
We're square.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Don't worry. I get it.
I get it.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
What?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
And where do we bring it?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
We're going to New York?
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
That's none of your fucking business.
What?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
He has a cute what...?
No...
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
She poured it for --
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
It's a digestif.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
No. I'll take a strega.
I'll get it.
Dip?
I am.
Scotland.
Edinburgh.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Yeah.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a chance --
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
That really you, Red?
Now.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
There's two guns on you.
I don't want your money.
You know it.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
The bitch was there.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
What you talking?
I'll take your goddam bet.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now. Baby, what's today?
Bet you are.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
It hit?
I'm working on it.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Solid, daddy.
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
When?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
Why?
Did you just now con me?
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do. 'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
I like you, country.
Is your papa West Indian?
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Man's rep travels.
Where I come from. Boston.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Keeps me out of the army.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
He had it coming.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Tell Him that.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
The body is a holy repository.
I sure met some.
Then the devil is white.
Who are you?
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Where am I gonna start?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
What the hell for, man?
What for?
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
That's what Mama used to say.
What do you do with your time?
Okay, okay.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Man, what do you want?
Who the hell are you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
+++$+++ And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
+++$+++ No, Brother Minister.
Come, sit with us.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Dear heart, where are you?
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Dear heart, I love you.
Shhh!
You have to sleep for three.
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
We need you too!
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
The talk is everywhere!
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I'm not made of glass.
How do you know?
Why are you looking at me like that?
What do you think?
You're with me even when you're away.
Hush your mouth.
Just hold me.
I love you.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Did you hear what I said?
At a gas station. Will you marry me?
I'm in Detroit.
What have you set your mind to?
Are you?
How old are you, Betty?
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
Why do you ask?
You have enough worries of your own.
I can handle it.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
There's nothing to talk about.
Delicious.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
If you want to tell me.
She ate.
+++$+++ Down front as always.
+++$+++ Let's cancel.
+++$+++ Brother Minister, what is wrong?
+++$+++ I assumed...
+++$+++ I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
+++$+++ Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
+++$+++ I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
+++$+++ Let some of us come down there.
+++$+++ Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
+++$+++ Let's get out of this cold.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
+++$+++ Just what are you saying?
+++$+++ Now just a moment, just a moment --
+++$+++ I told you we don't know for certain.
+++$+++ Just what is your question?
+++$+++ That's right.
+++$+++ I don't think we know for certain.
+++$+++ Why don't you just ask your question?
+++$+++ Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
+++$+++ Let him finish.
+++$+++ Entirely.
+++$+++ You put it very well.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Please, go ahead.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Did you see the papers today?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
If you want to tell me.
Say what you're saying.
What?
Sure, man.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
If she got eyes, she do.
With him?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
I say a lot of things.
MALCOLM X +++$+++ Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
MALCOLM X +++$+++ Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
MALCOLM X +++$+++ But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
MALCOLM X +++$+++ The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
I do know I love you.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
I know where you're going.
I ain't stupid.
Now you come back.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
Did you hear me?!
Get out.
+++$+++ I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
+++$+++ -- there is a serious question as to whether --
+++$+++ It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
You're my father.
Let me die then.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Another one?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
How many you turning out?
You had the number.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You evil this morning.
You the man.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Yeah.
You the man!
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
You're too small to be Bogart.
The hell you are.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Eat lead, coppers.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Fine as May wine.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Well, all reet, then.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Head nigger in charge?
You want to be the head man?
Might be all right.
So what about him?
What can you do?
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Allah will provide.
Are you sure?
He told you that?
+++$+++ I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
+++$+++ They talked about me like
+++$+++ I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
+++$+++ This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
+++$+++ We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
Creasy... I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be. The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
I don't know shit about you.
What do you want?
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
Am I a suspect?
No.
What am I doing here?
[Senor?]
[Why?]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[Where are you coming from?]
Deal.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
Give me the address.
Where does he live?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where do I find you?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
So what do I get in return?
So where do we begin?
It's a little late.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
A lot of people are looking for you.
[What is his name?]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Daniel.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Si.]
+++$+++ [Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
+++$+++ [The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
+++$+++ [We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
+++$+++ [The boss did or his brother.]
+++$+++ [No!]
+++$+++ [Four-seven-four-seven.]
+++$+++ [The what?]
+++$+++ [We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
+++$+++ [Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
Who's he?
[Who's he?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[I believe you.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[What do you mean?]
[Yeah. Yes.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[How much do you want?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Please, don't...]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
And what if amateurs try it?
How does it affect you?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
Is it loaded?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Show me, please.
Were you provided with a gun?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Yes or no?
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Creasy?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
You mean a misfire?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I came to visit you.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Yeah, right...
But don't you stay in El Paso?
So how's business?
Nothing wrong.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Be a swimmer.
Then be trained.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
You think too much?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You don't drink like you used to.
Could I ask you a question?
The blocks.
Your father has business.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I know you're not.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Where's my mother?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Two or three.
No.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
I don't understand.
No, that was in Columbia.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
You need to practice.
In a week you should be fine.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Did you sleep alright?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
My ankle.
Everywhere!
It hurts.
They'll be back in a week.
It's better to be free, right?
How do you think he got out?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
I go to school, don't I?
I'm not crying.
Oh...
So you were unhappy?
Hmmm?
No.
No.
That's right.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
Time will tell.
I'm a bargain.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
I'm looking for potential.
No.
No.
The United States.
Creasy...
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Who's Emilio?
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy... Wait.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
Planned what?
Because... I was already dead.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
I'm fine.
Never.
So are you.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Last night. Do you know something?
Where are you?
Rosanna Guerrero.
For an American she understands this country very well.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For a year?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Do you know what she told me last night?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
[No. Why?]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[You have the money.]
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Bye, Mom.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
You do?
This is Mr. Creasy.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
Good news. You're going back to school.
You should be sleeping, baby.
She's young. She'll get over it.
He has to go.
It's not.
Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father.
Creasy.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
She likes him.
I think it's fantastic.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Our child's safety is at stake.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
[Who's that?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[I know this. Your point?]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Is that good or bad?]
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
I can take care of myself.
That's what friends do.
Two tourists who never went home.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I already ate.
So am I.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
+++$+++ Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
+++$+++ You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
+++$+++ She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
Where you going?
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
It must be one o'clock.
What for?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
I been looking all over for you!
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Down there. That little one there.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
I'll call her up.
I could see she likes you.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something. Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
+++$+++ Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
+++$+++ I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
+++$+++ That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
+++$+++ Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.
+++$+++ Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
+++$+++ Marty.
+++$+++ Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
+++$+++ I know it pains.
+++$+++ Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
+++$+++ Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
+++$+++ You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
+++$+++ This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
+++$+++ Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
+++$+++ You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
+++$+++ Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
+++$+++ Ufa!
+++$+++ What happen?
+++$+++ You told me.
+++$+++ Well, it ain't your baby.
+++$+++ It's her baby too, you know.
+++$+++ Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
+++$+++ Who?
+++$+++ I don't think I remember him.
+++$+++ Oh.
+++$+++ We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
+++$+++ I feel fine.
+++$+++ I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
+++$+++ I came to see you. How you feel?
Okay.
Okay.
We just live one flight up.
How do you do?
Nothing.
All right.
I'll wait for your call.
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
Marty...
No...
No...
Marty...
No, Marty, please...
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life. And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Come on inna dining room.
This is the kitchen.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Wadda you think?
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I don't.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Thank you.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I'm having a very good time, too.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
+++$+++ Goodnight.
+++$+++ Sure.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
Are you kidding?
What?
I'm stag.
You say something?
+++$+++ I'll see you around.
+++$+++ Where you going now?
+++$+++ I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's a sad story.
WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
WOMAN +++$+++ And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
WOMAN +++$+++ She was always a bit thin in the hips...
What time is it?
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
What girl, what does she know? Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat? She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
+++$+++ So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
+++$+++ I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
+++$+++ Don't bring her to the house no more.
+++$+++ I don't like her.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
+++$+++ I said, is she Italian girl?
What, Ma?
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
I heard you, Ma.
+++$+++ Sure.
+++$+++ Sure.
+++$+++ Sure.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
+++$+++ Hello, Marty, when you come home?
+++$+++ Marty...
+++$+++ You not ugly.
+++$+++ Put on your blue suit...
+++$+++ You gonna die without a son.
+++$+++ Marty...
+++$+++ You gonna get married.
+++$+++ Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
+++$+++ Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
+++$+++ Tomatoes.
+++$+++ I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
+++$+++ Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
+++$+++ You gotta good heart.
+++$+++ Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Hiya.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hello, Ralph.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
...and they sit down right next to me...
So these two girls come over to the bar...
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
+++$+++ Well...
+++$+++ I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
+++$+++ That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
+++$+++ Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
+++$+++ Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
+++$+++ Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
+++$+++ Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
+++$+++ He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
+++$+++ The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
+++$+++ Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
+++$+++ You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking.
+++$+++ We gotta ask Marty, of course.
+++$+++ She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
+++$+++ Sure, sure.
+++$+++ I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
+++$+++ I'm gonna see you tonight...
+++$+++ That's all right, that's all right...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
+++$+++ Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
+++$+++ She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
+++$+++ He coming home right now.
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Wadda you so sore about?
Tommy...
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I don't wanna talk about it!
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it. I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night. Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
He's parted his moorings.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
+++$+++ There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Well... I was going to name you Chief Surgeon... To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
How you, Radar?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Just one for a start.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Look at that right eye.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Pour one for Painless.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
No. Or why you should.
Back home.
Hospital.
That's right.
Home.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
You make a mean martini, kid.
Same general idea.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
I don't drink intoxicants.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon... I got something for you.
What the hell's going on here?
Perfectionist.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win. I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy. You're a witness.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon. Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
What do you think, Trapper?
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
The chest-cutter.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
We been had.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Duke Forrest.
I can't... couldn't.
Don't stop now! Please...
+++$+++ And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
+++$+++ It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
+++$+++ Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
+++$+++ Ravenous. What about you?
+++$+++ We think the same way.
+++$+++ I think it's a marvelous letter.
People will talk.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond. But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
+++$+++ Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
+++$+++ The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
+++$+++ You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
+++$+++ Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
+++$+++ If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I think I heard about that.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
+++$+++ I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
+++$+++ I want to talk to you, Pierce.
You betcher ass, General.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
All you have to do is ask. The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
I found a doner.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
SERGEANT +++$+++ Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
SERGEANT +++$+++ C-A-M-E-M...?
SERGEANT +++$+++ We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Not necessarily.
He can move in here with us.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
They're coming.
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
I don't feel anything.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Radar!
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
What's the age of consent in this country?
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Look.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
No, no, that one.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
An eternal damnation.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
I like an olive.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
+++$+++ No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
Okay, Major, honey. I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine. See you around the campus.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
That's right. We work well together.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Hang in there.
See you.
What's the matter?
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
The bastards outconned us.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all. Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
+++$+++ A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
+++$+++ You're asking for somebody else?
+++$+++ Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship. Poor baby.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Maria...
+++$+++ But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye. You helped me pull together when I needed it.
+++$+++ It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
+++$+++ You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
+++$+++ I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
+++$+++ And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
+++$+++ Very happily married.
+++$+++ But I'm married.
+++$+++ You're an attractive man.
+++$+++ Our minds?
+++$+++ Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
+++$+++ You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
+++$+++ How did you get called that?
+++$+++ Thank you, Captain Pierce. It's been so long.
+++$+++ Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Why would he do that?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Yeah!
I didn't have much choice.
Duke...
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Thanks.
CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off. You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Yes, Reverend?
CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
+++$+++ He's coming to.
What's wrong with him?
What's the story?
Why can't you look at him?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
The one and only.
+++$+++ Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
How much time do I have?
In the direction you want to go.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Just in dreams?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Homosexuality.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it. I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
There's only one worth noticing.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
I don't think so either.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
That. It's out of the act.
You can cut the bow.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
We don't want any more than that. Right now.
About that chest-cutter...
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
If you mean... She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
You mean who hit who?
And another one, but it's from the south. There.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Good morning, Colonel.
Oh, get out of here!
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Yes, dammit, and...
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
O'Reilly!
What's that, Henry?
They can't do that to me!
I used to throw the javelin.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
+++$+++ It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
+++$+++ Captain... 'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
+++$+++ Good morning.
+++$+++ But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Now?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
+++$+++ The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
That bad? But I guess you're right. We might as well see him. Got any caddie carts?
What's the bastard really like?
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
+++$+++ As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
+++$+++ Nice.
Arterial silk.
How is he?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Did you get it, too?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
I guess so. Then what happened?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Yeah, that's the one.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
About me?
No.
No, thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Hello, John.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Oh. Yeah.
Who?
Who?
No.
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Yes!
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Against anything. Just protest.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yeah. No, no! No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Here. Sit down! Quiet, egghead! All right, now, a serious expression.
Action?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Huh?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
+++$+++ Hello?
+++$+++ Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
A third party?
+++$+++ Go ahead, open it, open it.
+++$+++ Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
+++$+++ No, no, no—that's your seat.
+++$+++ All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much for everything.
+++$+++ Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er— This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
A hundred dollars!
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Money.
Thirty dollars.
Yes, sir.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear? It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Wait a minute . . .
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
The Websters!
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
What's the idea?
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night! No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Take it easy, John Doe.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Yes. What's he doing here?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, maybe you're right.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
All right, boys, here he is.
Oh.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
That's our man. He's made to order.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Packs everything, including a gun. Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
I can read. I can read!
Plus a bonus.
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Well, you're catching on.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
John Doe.
So?
Sure! When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
You made it up.
Say that again.
We'll get a handwriting expert to— What!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
The letter from John Doe.
The letter.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
He's watching the other door.
I ain't seen him for a week.
No.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
That's—
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
+++$+++ Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
+++$+++ Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
+++$+++ I used to pitch.
+++$+++ Yeah, a little.
. . . Tubby?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Boss?
What do they want?
What?
Beany!
Shut up!
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
St-rike!
Ba-ll!
Sure. Mostly often.
Who are they?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
The heelots!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you. Yes sir, they got you!
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Naw.
+++$+++ What Bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
+++$+++ Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
+++$+++ Grubbel's here. See?
+++$+++ Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
A gag. A gag!
It must be some kind of a gag.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural. There are snickers from the background.
John Doe Club?
Yeh.
Four bits.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Sure, you are.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
I trust him.
+++$+++ I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
+++$+++ Why—uh—
+++$+++ Well?
+++$+++ Huh? Get what?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time. Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now. Amateur journalism, huh! I'll show those guys.
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up. Oh, Ned!
How?
+++$+++ Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
+++$+++ Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
+++$+++ No, I didn't.
+++$+++ There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
+++$+++ Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
+++$+++ Did you write it—or didn't you?
+++$+++ And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
+++$+++ Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
+++$+++ Let go of me! This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! Do you deny that?
+++$+++ It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine! So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh? You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
+++$+++ You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
+++$+++ Did you want to see her about something important?
+++$+++ No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
+++$+++ I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
+++$+++ Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Okay.
Yeah.
Feller runs the Chronicle . Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
I know one way you can do it.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Racket? What do you mean?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
What do you mean, too bad?
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
No, sir.
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin ! Why, he's liable to go right past my window, What was that?!
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Spencer of the Chronicle .
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Good. I don't want to be late.
You want me to go up with you?
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Where's the stereo?
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Yeah, okay.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Deal.
You're my hero.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
Not that we know of.
I don't know.
No -- you can't do that.
SWAT wants to go in.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Clarence Teal.
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Could I please have a little water?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Who is it?
I won't get away with it.
Don't make do it, Mike.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
What happened, Mike.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
Is that where you're family lives?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Huh?
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
They want Walter dead!
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
You can't help me, man.
You got it.
Manual or automatic?
What?!
Am I gettin' the car?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
I need to get something straight first.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
I what?
Is there a problem?
#2 +++$+++ Johnny who?
#2 +++$+++ Who are you again?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
What do you got on Korda?
Anything on Korda so far?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Earl.
That's right.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
Hi, Roper.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
It's all there.
Satisfied?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
I'll give you something.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
For now that's all.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Yep.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Stay put.
McCall, you all right?
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything. How are we going to get me in there?
That's a chance I gotta take.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
And what if you can't live with it?
And what about the ones you don't save?
How many have you lost?
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy. It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Pull up alongside.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Damnit!
And doing a very good job of it.
There's your answer. He's smart.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Is it always like this?
How long you been coming here?
How much you wanna bet?
We lost.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
COME ON RUSSELL!... Who the fuck's Russell?!
They need to run first and second?
The 6 horse is still last.
To run last?
The 6 horse is last.
Still needs work.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Fine.
I do.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think?
You know why I like the track?
Why did he do it?
What did you see?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
To save lives.
Yes.
You tell me.
What's the first commandment?
You know the ten commandments?
Get good at it.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
I can't do that.
Tell me what you need.
No.
I think so.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Do you really?
Every couple of months, huh?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Explain how that works.
You living together?
I don't gamble.
Why? You like my ass?
Well, if I have to, I have to.
I don't really like to drink.
Not the ones I'm at.
We could fill it with water.
I'm not sure.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for "fast advancement".
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
How did you like Toronto?
You'd never been out of New York?
You don't like New York?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Recruited you from where?
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
What's the point of this?
I know.
I've rarely shot anyone.
Like it had to be done.
Only at the very end.
If you say so.
Sorry... Habit.
I'm ready to do it. And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
+++$+++ Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
+++$+++ Only that floor.
Which apartment?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Let me show you something, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Prude.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
...the hell are you talking about?
Scott...
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
I was just thinking... There's something special I want to talk to you about. I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship. A deeper level.
Yeah.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Do it!
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie, Scottie...
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Korda escaped.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Yeah?
There is?
It's very nice.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
Just now.
It's okay. We broke up.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Scottie...
Yeah that's it.
Mmm, needs a little something.
And it's hard to get.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
As a matter of fact, I do.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
If you did, you never showed it.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
What do you want from me?
I've proved that, didn't I?
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
That a new picture?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe you should be.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
Hey.
Please. I'm begging you.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I worship you.
This baseball player you're going out with... He's no good for you.
+++$+++ Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
+++$+++ Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Come on!
Are these yours?
What have you promised them?
Any verification on numbers.
What do we got?
Who's running it!
Who's running it?
I want to be put on this case.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... I want to be put on this case.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
Repoed this morning.
The car is part of the deal.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
And a car.
Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Your concern is heartwarming.
Define concern.
Depends. What's up?
What?
He says, "Thank you very much." I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
-- But don't you remember? I'm already dead.
True.
-- You've made your point! You've got control of the system.
God-Damn you!
They have nothing to do with this --
There are two million people in there with you.
What do you need?
What do you want?
This is Halden.
+++$+++ Why --
+++$+++ How come I can't remember?
+++$+++ She said I have a son...
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ Okay...
From the dream.
It's time to wake up.
What's happening?
But this is impossible.
Guests?
Yes.
No...
Someone who believes in miracles.
About what?
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
Your life that bad?
This is how you pick up women --
That's a strange question. You a strange man?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
Only up there in the dream they called life.
One would assume so.
Yes.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want. Redwood forests. Oceans. Mountains --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Yes...
Not real?
The new world.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God. End into beginning.
You are not a God.
Divinity?
Not my problem.
Then what?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out. So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
But what if he doesn't --
You sure he's going to come?
And what about the reconfiguration?
Where the hell are you going?
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
The maze has been changed --
What about the customers with reservations?
At least a day.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Take care? Where the hell are you going --
There is no --
Who?
The weather.
I'm South Dakota.
Where you plugged-in from?
Insurance?
Need the disk back!
Where?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
There was no need to kill her.
We drugged her. So she wouldn't remember.
Why would I do that?
Katie was digitized.
The truth.
-- Who did he digitize?!
Who did he digitize?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Why?
It's not used for anything.
The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
The truth.
One condition.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary. It's not worth it.
And you weren't involved.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Christoph had spinal cancer. His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate. It was him, it wasn't us --
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Go!
-- Yes.
-- He won't.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Sorry, I just design the maze. Keeping the keys secure is your job.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Of course the legend would like to think that. But no one has keys. Your maze was run.
There was no other choice.
I'm sorry.
Not you. A copy.
I know.
Way you kiss me.
Yes.
You weren't real.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
It was a test.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Yes.
Her?
Corporation can.
Identical. One's you. One's digital.
-- The inside?
Who are you?!
What are you talking about?
Then how do you know about --
You went to my high-school?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
Someone you have to get back to?
I've got to get back.
Cleaning up a mess.
Of course you do. And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Just like that --
My uni-net account. I log on. The program's there.
It was just there.
Because you'll never believe me.
This. No point to it.
Of course you do. And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
You don't need a lawyer. We found the program on your laptop.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
Wait a second... What time is it?
Speed?
+++$+++ Zordon... he's gone.
+++$+++ Rangers... I'm afraid you're too late.
+++$+++ Ay, yi, yi, yi. The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
+++$+++ It's far too dangerous. Zordon would never allow it.
Alpha. Is there any way we can defeat this monster? Any way at all?
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Wow. Sand.
Yeah, right.
Ah... sure.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
They're called squirbs.
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
I've got it! We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
There should be a way to open it.
I've never been this sore in my life.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Everybody hold on tight. We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
What does that mean?!
Thank you, Dulcea. For everything.
Activating Power Beam!
WHITE TIGER!
... Let's take a look over there.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
... I just pray we're not too late.
... We must try to communicate with them.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late! Ivan is on his way here!
+++$+++ To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.

What's a Triac?
Close. Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
In another time, another dimension. It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
All systems go!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
Of course! The power is of another world. Another dimension.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
You okay?

That's the only way to the Monolith...
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
I'm in!
Let's go after him!!
... Not bad.
SKULL!!
There goes the neighborhood.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
Here you go! No pushing!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Be the eagle. Be the eagle.
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
And how do we release the power?
... A falcon?
It's... an eagle?
And how do we do that?
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Wait for me!
Did I say anything?
How about Major Moron?
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way. And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?! It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS! Not to mention...
GO IVAN!!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
Quack like a'duck!
Ah, the old and doddering. I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry. I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils! And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
You want me to place a few calls?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR! KEEP DIGGING. THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY. ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
What do you mean "basically"?
So they've been destroyed?
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
GO POWER RANGERS!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
How dare you?! Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!

+++$+++ The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
+++$+++ Awwh, Charlie.
+++$+++ But I've never served a day.
+++$+++ What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
+++$+++ But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
+++$+++ What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
+++$+++ Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
+++$+++ One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Poor, yeah.
Tell me about it.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Charlie Luciano.
+++$+++ Not another word.
+++$+++ Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
+++$+++ Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Whatever you say, Boss.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Up here, Boss.
+++$+++ What do you mean?
+++$+++ Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
+++$+++ And now you have everything.
+++$+++ Life knocked me back.
+++$+++ I had everything. Once.
+++$+++ Are you frightened?
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
Could we step outside?
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
If we have to.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Four-twenty-eight.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
+++$+++ It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
+++$+++ Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear. Black Hand.
+++$+++ Shane was a friend of yours?
+++$+++ They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Who hired the bastard?
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Bastard didn't even show.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
The deal's too good, Frankie
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
You ain't even a man yet.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
That's it.
Well...
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
+++$+++ I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
I'm doin' business here!
It always is.
+++$+++ You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
If I look weak now, it's over.
London?
Gives us something in common.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Have you thought about this?
You got something to hide?
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Same here.
Something came up.
Luciano.
+++$+++ I'm already late.
+++$+++ I must be going.
+++$+++ No. I'm here with you.
+++$+++ For being a man.
+++$+++ No. They envy you.
+++$+++ Inside, they were talking of you.
+++$+++ Julius Caesar never took no vote.
+++$+++ Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
+++$+++ Who'll make the rules?
+++$+++ Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
+++$+++ Charlie!
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
What's your problem?
Tommy Reina.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
It'll just be a few minutes.
I told you twenty!
I'll do fine.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
How soon can we pull this off?
I'll handle the Boss.
Like Don Maranzano.
Like a party for all our friends.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Married? To Anna? You ain't got her in trouble?
Meyer.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
We'll figure out something.
So what is the problem?
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
They don't give a shit about us!
Ben-jamin.
Come off it, Bugs.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Not stupid. Fat.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
But that's an hour's drive.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Not if they all die at once.
They're friends of our enemy.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You gotta plan these things.
Didn't know you felt that way.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
I know about you.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
He's trying to make it.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Never threaten me, Boss.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
See if these two are my friends.
You boys carryin' pieces?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Ya piss like a man.
I like that.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
Forget it. That's past.
You disrespect our tradition.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
They do what I tell 'em.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
That's why I'm here.
I found that out.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
You get fifteen percent.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
He's an animal!
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
And how many soldiers do you have?
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I must know more of you, my son.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Guess I'm just lucky.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
You wouldn't live out the week.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Forget it.
Jesus.
Come on. Be polite.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Spare us.
Shuddup.
COLL +++$+++ Now that's a hard number.
COLL +++$+++ Anything ain't a very hard number.
COLL +++$+++ What's it worth to ya, Boss?
COLL +++$+++ What a cozy little scene.
Luciano is dead?
Yes?
But only on purpose, Tommy.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Take any one ya like.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
That a Jew compliment?
Just wanted ta say hello.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Monkeybone?
What?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Who did this?
Special occasion?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Stu Miley.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Uhh - martini?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Thank me next time you see me.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
DEATH!!
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
+++$+++ Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
+++$+++ Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
+++$+++ At the moment, yes.
+++$+++ He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
+++$+++ Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
You're really gonna pop the question?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
How much?
Less.
What's the matter?
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Holy shit.
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Monkeybone...!?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Tell me what?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
He called me "Doc."
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
You sure this is...medically advisable?
What are you watching?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
I'd better go report this...
Are you okay??
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
What's the "bad" part?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Who?
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
What?
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
Stu...Stu...
Where'd he go??
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
<u>What</u> union?
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
+++$+++ That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City. We do not allow his kind on this block.
+++$+++ You don't have to worry. She's going to be fine. We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
+++$+++ Who told you we deal drugs?
+++$+++ We like to think so, yeah.
+++$+++ Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
Have a nice day.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Well, bye. And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I love you, Mom. I have to run. You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Mother!
Here you go. I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing. Okay?
Dear, I was thinking. Why don't we go to Paris next year? I've never been. Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Mm hmm.
I'm sorry.
Aaron?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
No, no, it's my fault. I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
That's not true. Besides, I don't want you dusting. I want you to see New York.
I don't want to talk about it.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Behind the books.
Mother!
What pictures?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
I'm good.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village. I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
Uh-huh?
That's New York. It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day. You'll get used to it.
You don't like where I live?
So, what do you think?
I wonder what they do in there? Don't they frighten you? They all look so ...
He's an organic farmer.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
What happened?
Really?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize. Calls made at three and four in the morning. So, I called the number ... and a woman answered. And I ... I hung up. So, then I followed him. Just like in the movies. And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn. We had been going together for almost a year.
I'm sorry. I had a wretched night.
She's at work. I'm her mother.
Who is it?
Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
I see. How much?
This way?
Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not during the day.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Moscow.
Yeah.
... Oh ...
So, you come here all by yourself?
And where is she?
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. It's my first time in New York. Just a minute.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Swell. Thanks very much. Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [ ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
But it *isn't*?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
You've never *seen* this contract.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
It was?
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Let's send out a pigeon!
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
Yes, sir. All right, boys--let's go.
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State-- Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--! Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
What!
Diz!
He's a house-afire!
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Why me?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Take me home, Diz.
Huh?
Right now--everything I own--!
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
My first name's--Clarissa.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Where?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
No.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Okay. You don't mind?
Any time.
How about getting married?
Diz--
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take-- Say--who started this?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Shut up, Diz.
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Yeah.
Drunks are funny--
Why do I always laugh at that?
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak. Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side. To genteel crime, kid.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Oh--yeah--
What dame?
Well, well-- Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today-- How come so early? Get the day off?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
You play--left field.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Who?
Certainly. Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
You know--little worms--ambition.
You got worms.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Would you settle for a husband?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up-- --*five more minutes*!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay! Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Otis!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Now, pet-- Jim!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent-- Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Taylor, my dear.
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Sam Foley--dead!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away.
Yes, yes--phone, phone-- A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this-- Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Oh! Go away.
All right, why?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Oh--oh.
He's batty!
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
*But you never asked me*!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
What!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Henry Hill.
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Horace Mill--!
One minute! Just one minute!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Himself!
I did. What about it?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
A dirty frame!
Jeff for Senator.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
A pet shop?
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor-- Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
I beg your pardon?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
What? Who?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Washington!
I yield.
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Will the Senator yield?
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Mr. President!
Where were you?
No, Jeff--please--!
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Mr. President--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Will he *yield*?
Will he yield for a question?
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Good as new! It's quite all right--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I will, sir! I will! I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Yes, I was--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Thank you, sir.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's.
Just fine.
Certainly would, Joseph.
Fine--
Hello, Jefferson.
Now, Amos, now-- What?
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Now, now, now! It's all right, Governor.
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Yes, Ma?
Oh, now--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some-- Governor Hopper!
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Can't you?
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on!
Hurray!
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
What you *have* to do is fight!
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
What are you going to do?
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
Hello.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Yes--right here. Just a second-- Miss Paine.
Don't mention it--
Oh--*Saunders*!
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate!
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous? Say--have I got some paper here?
Already? All these letters?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time-- I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him. "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar. By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
No--
In Terry Canyon?
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee-- Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh. Well, Saunders--let's go--
I've got more. You better tell me.
Lena.
Letitia.
Abigail.
I know. It's--Violet.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along. YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now-- What's your *first* name?
Saunders. That's better. Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders-- Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Have you always had to--work?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
You mean--here?
No.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
He did?
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
I did--and--and I got right up.
Uh--have you? Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Thanks very much.
Yes--sure. Why not? You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
Pardon?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down. Are you catching on, Senator?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
What?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Good. Where are we?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Committee.
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Tonight. Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
A *day*!
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Go ahead--punch.
You *couldn't*?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
No. What had you better--?
With or without 'em. Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Convene?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
Well--he's got nothing on me.
Most natural thing in the world!
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Oh, no--no! My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
J-Jefferson Smith.
No!
*No*!
What is it?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean-- I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit. I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
That's--that's splendid.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to-- Uh--how's your father?
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again. Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Then you *did* say it.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
How are the pigeons?
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Wonderful!
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Ring the call to quorum.
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
"So help me God."
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Yes, *sir*. Let's *go* Henry.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
How's that, buddy?
Well--I can *manage*--
Great! The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Swell!
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break. Now, where'd you say you studied law?
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
I know that.
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think-- This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Let's get away from here.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
What's the matter?
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Okay. See you here.
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well, well!
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
I thought I could, too. *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--! Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Do you?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
He's lost complete faith in me--
Yes--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now-- I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
What do you mean?
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Oh, now--that won't do--
Well--that's very fine. Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
No?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders. Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until-- Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
No--I--I'll take a walk--
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Anything *better* to offer?
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
You can't say *that* to--
Jim!
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought. Let him in.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
You won't stand for it?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
What do you think?
That's him. Let him in.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Father--oh.
Do I actually *see* this--?
His first 'whiff'!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Page boys!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body! Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide! Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Senator Paine will state it!
Will the Senator yield?
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Senator Paine.
+++$+++ Certainly.
+++$+++ Put that away, slug! At your service!
That's going to be fun.
+++$+++ Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
+++$+++ No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Deeds?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
He sure is.
Yes, indeedy.
Uh-huh.
Always.
Yes, you own it.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
And sings.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Pixilated.
They think he's pixilated.
Most every day.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Next, please.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify. Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Any children?
Are you married?
+++$+++ I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
+++$+++ I haven't.
+++$+++ No.
Yes!!!
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
That's all, Miss Bennett.
And you saw them happen?
But they did take place?
Are they true!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Are these the articles?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Hello, Mary?
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Yes, here we are again. Good night.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
In a day or so, I think.
Mary, I'm going home.
Let's just walk, okay?
Thank you.
Ready?
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
I'd like to read it some time.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
It had better be good.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Yeah, I know.
He played in the town band, too.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
I've often thought about going back.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12] Except you, of course. People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
Oh, I don't know.
What did you mean by that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Here's a nice place.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President— Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
That depends on what they see.
Huh?
It's wonderful.
Yeah, let's.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Uh-huh.
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
I enjoy it.
Oh, I don't mind.
Really?
No. That is, I didn't— Until I met you. I like talking to you, though— Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Oh - uh - nothing.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living. Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow. You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
You fainted.
Why there she is! Of course she's home. Stupid of me . . .
Just a minute. No, you don't.
You're acting like a school girl.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Yeah, then what?
Why? Why do we have to do it?
I'm crucifying him.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Don't be ridiculous.
No. It's nothing.
Nothing.
Hello . . .
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
That's the rub.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh? What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Why, Babe - that's terrific! "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
What's bothering you, huh?
With pay! She is out the door.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Tonight, maybe. I'll phone him at noon. Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Had the boys follow us.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Have lunch.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
With pay!
Can I have a month's vacation?
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Look, I can do it!
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Boy, was he burning.
Shhh!
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Hurry up!
Right.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
Yes, but you said—
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Close that door. Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
I wish you luck, sir.
How is this, sir?
Me sir?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Stuff, sir?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her. Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Is that the best you've got?
Fourteen carat?
Gold, eh?
How's it going? Okay?
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
They are? I forgot all about them. What do you think they want?
Let me go!
I wanna see that guy!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Nuisance value. Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Nuisance value?
Relatives of old man Semple.
+++$+++ Come on, John. What happened?
+++$+++ Better wire him right away, John.
Mr. Cedar!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Mr. Cedar!
Proceed.
What was that you said he was?
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
This is outrageous!
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
That tuba player!
Look!
You can't?
See you later, kid.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days. Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
Wants to know who the heir is.
Okay.
Yeah?
All set.
Mandrake Falls. M-A-N—
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds. Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Huh?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No, thank you.
When?
What for?
Who - me? No.
Buffer?
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Why, no.
Yes.
All right.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
How do you do.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, thanks.
+++$+++ No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine. Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
+++$+++ Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Thank you. If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
Are those stories true?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Arthur wants to quit!
Okay, you're the boss. When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf. Beautiful.
That's funny. Why is that?
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
No, thanks.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
I've got one for Cobb—
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Me?!
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
We own an opera house, don't we?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
+++$+++ It takes so long to detect them— —because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
+++$+++ It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
+++$+++ Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
+++$+++ You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
—my wife wanted me to tell you she— —she prays for you every night.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want? A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Let him alone.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
No, I mean - about my client.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
A child? My uncle's?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Well, I play the tuba.
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Thank you, Your Honor.
No. Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Not at all.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil. I was watching you.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Take the stand!
Yes?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Brookfield just came in.
I write poetry.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Fun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever. Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet— —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life! A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious! You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
+++$+++ I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Now you keep out of this!
Don't pay any attention to her.
Of course they're going to stay. She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top? Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
+++$+++ You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
+++$+++ I don't know.
Oh. Oh!
South Dakota - north?
Where is your farm?
Farmer?
What is your name?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
You mean— —by the neck or something?
Yeah. What?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
No! What do you want!!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Me, sir?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Hey, did you hear that?
But she's on the telephone—
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Looking for?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
What do you mean? I remember everything! Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Prairie? Oysters?
What's that?
I just wanted to make sure.
You're Walter, aren't you?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
What do you think you're doing?
What - tails? Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me? I never wore one of those things in my life.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Doubtful. What did he say?
You must have been concerned.
What happened?
One hundred books?
Uh-huh. What are they?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous. I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Why are they ganging up against me?
What do they want from me? What have I done that's so wrong? They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... Even you probably have things.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Were you supposed to have a session?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Why's that?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
Could you come with me please?
Dr. Mumford.
+++$+++ But you do therapy?
+++$+++ You're the shrink, aren't you?
+++$+++ Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
...And I from Phyllis.
You never got back to me. ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
I think he's got a point.
What an asshole!
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
What's that?
I see.
What kind of doubts?
How do you mean?
My approach?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
Are we?
Right now?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to... ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
What exactly is it supposed to do?
Should I open it now?
What is it?
What's that?
I was... never satisfied.
We got divorced. I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
Go to hell.
I never said that.
No?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Why? I'm paying for this.
What?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Why not?
I have eighteen more minutes!
What brought this on?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
What do you think's wrong with her?
Tastes good.
A little.
You've done well.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you do?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
I've had my moments.
Nope.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Yes.
Yes, your honor.
+++$+++ Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
+++$+++ Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Yeah.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
What are they?
That's a lot of people all at once.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Oh?
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Lily.
...so accomplished.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You're on your own today, honey.
They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour.
Why do you watch?
...And?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It's a pretty piece of land.
Doc. Ainge...
Not sure. Let me think about it.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You know who that is, don't you? You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
How long you been in this town?
What do you want to know?
It was Henry Follett.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
My patient had to leave early.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
You're right, as usual. See you.
Hello, Lionel.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like -- -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
How are you?
Martin.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
What's wrong with her?
I'm trying.
That would explain it.
You're good.
Don't need it.
Sure.
Mother... go away!
+++$+++ What kind of doctor are you?
+++$+++ Do you think that's a good idea?
+++$+++ What's happening here?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
+++$+++ Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
+++$+++ Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
+++$+++ -- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
+++$+++ Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
+++$+++ I think you do.
+++$+++ I think you know what I mean.
+++$+++ Finally, some common sense...
There's something I think we need to talk about.
That's right, the fake kind.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Will you be here?
Will you wait for me?
What is your name?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Oh.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
What?
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
But...
You deserve it.
You feel violated?
...How violated I feel?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Which show was that?
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Hello?
Transference.
What was that?
I think so.
Okay...
I don't follow you.
I'm glad.
Um-huh.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Is it something you've heard about me?
You're upset.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Of course.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. Not one who's treating me, of course. And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I bet I know what changed your mind... ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Which thing?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
And this is legitimate therapy?
It's all right.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
And he's where?
So whose route is this?
Is that when you split up?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
That was really bad, wasn't it?
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this... ...because you think this is good for me... ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You're doing great.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
Is that like a party trick?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
Life.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Sore throat?
Be specific.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Is this the treatment?
No.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
Please... forgive me.
Something's bothering her.
Is she against you getting help?
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
I'm not making any promises.
Maybe you'll catch it.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll work it out.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
What would you do?
Even if you don't think it's real?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
No.
What?
When did you start to feel this way?
What can you tell me about this?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
He agreed?
Really?
No again?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
Do you think that's what he wants?
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
What are you talking about?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
What do you want me to see?
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... Which we already knew...
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Where was this?
It's my bit for the community.
It's called pro bono.
It's a big part of the show.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Weekly or monthly?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Yep.
What?
Yes, yes it does...
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Wow.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Lily.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty -- Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Psych major?
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
And a birth certificate is enough?
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
All new people start with that...
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
Who'd you go with? That's not good.
That'd be Lily.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
You and Candy...?
At least you pulled yourself out...
But look at me now...
"Get to know your therapist."
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Did you carry a gun?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Sounds like you have several.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
I can tell you anything else.
It matters to me.
Damn! What is your name?
Just you.
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Really?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
You don't think I'm insane?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Guess. Go ahead, guess!
Okay... let's say that, for now.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever. And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
It's just a thought.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Yep.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
Hey, Skip.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
What?
Unbelievable... ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Good-looking woman.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Okay then. Have you got a lot of friends?
Don't you like this?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
This is exactly what I wanted.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
I've got three big ones.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
Is that the question?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Nah... scotch.
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
How are you?
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
When?
Well, okay then.
I never killed a priest before.
Who the hell are these guys?
You know where he's taking her?
+++$+++ No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
+++$+++ I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
+++$+++ If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
+++$+++ And then killing your sister.
+++$+++ By reading the Book Of The Dead.
+++$+++ The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
You're not going to kill us?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
You shall see.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
What friend? You're my only friend.
Do you know where I can steal some?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
'Cause I look good doin, it.
C'mon, friend.
Goin' somewhere?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Let's make us even, shall we?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
Altar boys?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Now go find me a big stick.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Intestines.
Oh yes, always.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
That's one way of putting it.
Exactly --
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
What is he doing here?
Perhaps.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
You will not believe it.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
What did you do to him!?
Water turning to blood.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
A bright good morning to all.
Twenty.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
I would never!
Three hundred pounds!
Two hundred pounds.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
No women allowed.
Where are they taking him?
And what did he say?
And what is he in prison for?
Got guts, lady.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got it!
I think you were jealous
You called me your girl?
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
I'm staying.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
It's everybody's problem!
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
No, we are not.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Is he supposed to look like that?
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
No... Why?... Should I?
Why would I do that?
I'm not?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
You two!
How?
Who was talking about what?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Preparation for what?
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
That "thing" gets me excited.
For what?
We're almost there.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Oh that's comforting.
I know my treasure.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
If you call that a kiss.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Really want to know?
Want to know?
I found sand. I saw death.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Every damn day.
Yeah, I was there.
I just decked your brother
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
No.
Broad?!
Yes,... I see.
What's it look like!?
Oh.
Read the inscription on the cover!
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Well neither do I, thank you.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
What do you suppose killed him?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs. Oh my.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Way to go, Evy.
Picked his pocket, actually.
That just makes you more gullible.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I was mistaken.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I think you found something.
Jonathan?
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Have you no respect for the dead?
You...! YOU...!
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
What?
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
That looked rather painful.
Who's here!?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
You did not!?... We're not!?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
None taken.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Hey,... don't I know you?
She's my sister, actually.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Except for one little thing.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I knew you'd know.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
Do I?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Our guests are waiting.
I thought you were done?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Where are you going?
Your mind is so slippery.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Atta, boy!
Do it, big boy!
And some sandwiches --
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
I was eight.
He was the last time I saw him.
We didn't think this through very well.
So who killed him?
Really?
I'm his daughter.
Or even what it looks like.
Let's do it.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
But you're a superhero.
I can't.
The Inscrutable Six?
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
Who are you?
Eat your mustard.
Hey... you okay?
Mon Captain, it's for you.
What did he mean?
Half a Dirty Dozen!
I thought you'd never ask.
Think positive.
Get on to yourself!
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
How's your dad?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Yes!
Yes!
That boy's got talent.
+++$+++ Should I kill them?
+++$+++ What about Captain Amazing?
+++$+++ But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Have you considered my offer?
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
And the light goes out...
You're dead.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Are you with me... or against me?
They always call the great ones nuts.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Stay away!
Who?
What?
I'd better go.
Curiosity.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Me.
Why not?
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Hi.
Sure -- I guess.
Really?
You underestimate yourself.
Are you an actress?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Bye.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
And what if you get killed?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
What are you talking about?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Monica, where are you?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
Me, too.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Yeah.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Roy.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Who wouldn't?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I admire you.
Sure.
Yeah.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Alone tonight?
Not tonight.
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
+++$+++ Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now! The great ones RIDE ALONE! Adios, muchachos!
My heart died a long time ago.
When I am sure I am among friends.
You drink too much.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And you are a fool.
With what?
Not a chance!
Are you coming or not?
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
But I just don't feel it.
Because that's what it is.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
SO WHAT?
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
There's a big difference.
There's just not enough of us.
You sure that's how you spell it?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
So when are we gonna have an on night?
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Oh don't start that again --
He's turned into a completely normal person!
What's that?
So where's the art?
Roy --
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Maybe there was traffic.
Sounds good.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Agents?
Maybe she's right.
I'm soaked. Oh great.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Wait!... Look!
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
See ya tomorrow.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Who's chicken?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it! And then they dump you.
Nah.
Why not?
So why don't you just tell her!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
There's a vague similarity.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
+++$+++ Hey... he's gone.
+++$+++ Anybody got any?
The Eradicators!
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Yes.
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Here you go.
So what can I get you?
Really?
Wow.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Are you famous?
We're superheroes.
Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me.
I always knew that you were special.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
But... the silverware?
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Mother... it's not what you think!
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Oh hi, Mom.
Right.
Where am I going?
We've got lift off!
It's time.
Oh no.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
That was too close.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Are you sure he's still lives here?
To us!
And a social life.
The who?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Shut up.
Be a Mohican.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Or Batman --
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Who are they?
Ask her out.
She likes you.
Hi.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it. If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit. I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered. Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet. And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you? You have had to rule with an iron hand. You have turned friends into enemies. And even at that, the result has only been partly effective. You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials. But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance. You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live. Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live. He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them. I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
+++$+++ I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter. In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris. But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
+++$+++ If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow. When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty. When Berlin fell, another treaty. That has always been the rules of the game. But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming? He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
+++$+++ Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads. Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
+++$+++ Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me. This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I. Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
+++$+++ I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
+++$+++ The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring! I don't think he can afford to.
+++$+++ Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
+++$+++ You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
+++$+++ Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
+++$+++ The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
+++$+++ I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
+++$+++ But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation. The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
+++$+++ I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
+++$+++ If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
+++$+++ Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
+++$+++ I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
What do you mean?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present. Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack. Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said. "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest." And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I think it's absolutely charming.
And, what a delightful idea!
Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
You realize what is at stake?
I must be honest with you. I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
There are none here.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
About 5,000 troops.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
Thank you for coming. Would you care for a drink?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in. Please sit down.
Please...
Yes, Captain? Have you anything you wish to say?
Yes -- who spoke up?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
I don't know, sire.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont. I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day. Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked. The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men. Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them? Where is Marmont? Where is Mortier?
Paris has surrendered?! I don't believe it.
And who is defending Paris?
And where is the army?
Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sire?
Bertrand, sire.
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I? She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
Ah, my poor Josephine. She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world. She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart. They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me? Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper? How incredible!
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
General Bonaparte?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure. I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose. Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
You may go, Captain Charles.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Just a minute, General. Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da. They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Ah-hh, no.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
No, they're living in Nice now.
I haven't been there for three years.
Ajaccio.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Yes, I am.
A glass of champagne, please.
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog? I would rather eat Cossack.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
How did it spread so quickly?
Why didn't you wake me then?
When did it start?
Four o'clock.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors. Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again. For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Indeed you have, Ambassador. Have you sent for a doctor?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
No, sir.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons. I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her?
Good morning, sir. Are you General Bonaparte?
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare. You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear. You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
I'll have the fire built up.
Would you like some brandy?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I see.
Oh...?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Lisette La Croix.
Lisette.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Yes, I am, sir.
Yes, it must be.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Good evening, sir.
Will you use the troops?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
When is she supposed to return?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
But you can do the same thing in six months. The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
You must not act impetuously.
You can't be serious. It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
And you, Junot?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
Junot?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
I would like both of you to read this. Please read it aloud.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness. And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Oh, my darling. I'm sorry, too. I won't do that again -- whatever you do. I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
It's me.
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
But you will not... be safe...
Separate bedrooms?
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Will you be joining us, soon?
What are you doing in there?
Where is Madame Trillaud?
I know what you're doing in there.
Open the door. It's me.
You are my old friend.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Promise.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Promise me.
Promise me you will never leave me.
She must have been in love with you.
Were any of them married?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Were they pretty?
Were you in love with any of them?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Do you expect me to believe that?
And now?
Were you in love with him?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais. I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais. Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Can you give me a drink, please?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
You mean you heard them making love?
You could hear them?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
I know.
God help me -- yes.
My God, what do you think?
About Hippolyte Charles.
I couldn't face telling you.
Yes, I wrote it.
I wrote it.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you. I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
You mean about my wife?! You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Now, just a minute. You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Why not?
Certainly.
All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Why did you give it to him?
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles? I asked for it yesterday.
There's probably some explanation.
Yes, yes, please sit down. I will be with you in a moment.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
+++$+++ If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
+++$+++ Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
+++$+++ No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
+++$+++ My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Oh, no, I am very happy. But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know. And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here? I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
I hope you have patience with me. I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views. I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Will I be able to play the harp? It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Do you like music?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Oh, then you are...
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
That is a matter of opinion.
Alexander and I are friends. We have reached an understanding.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France. It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties. The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
We have a treaty with Austria.
I very seriously doubt it. I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy. With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse. More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
That is correct.
Yes, he has.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Does she deserve anything better?
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech. Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you. Now, will you please come down at once. You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac. I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant. You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Let me have it.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Show him in.
Is he alone?
What did you say his name was?
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded. Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time. The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
I know Alexander. His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon. The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France. He would later say: "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy. Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769. He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion. In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
And I can go free?
That's it?
Anything you need.
+++$+++ Don't move me.
+++$+++ Thank you. I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Yup.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
+++$+++ Passed out? Can't hang, huh? Boy, I knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
+++$+++ Suga!
+++$+++ Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
Why you say that?
+++$+++ Good.
+++$+++ Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
+++$+++ Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
+++$+++ Cash money. They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan. That's for suckas. They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
+++$+++ Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig. I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
+++$+++ Well, let me in.
+++$+++ Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working. My back keep going out... she don't never get enough. But check this out. I got to lay some ground rules. Your my family and I love you. You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
+++$+++ Send Betty my love. Boy you looking good. I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside. I got something to show you.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Ain't the rest room this way? I gotta pee.
Can I look for myself?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Yes you did.
I'm his cousin.
Cheeco.
Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us. Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
What about the dog?
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Black magic.
Come on, Day, try it. For moms.
That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Not me.
I'm gone.
What you mean talk to her?
Great moves, Day-Day.
No I'm not.
Shut up. I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin. They're right there in the back.
Nobody!
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I ain't trying to rob you...
I will. When can I come visit?
You sure you don't wanna stay?
You're welcome, Unc.
Wait here? So Cheeco can bite my ass off? Tell me where it is I'll do it.
What you see?
Wait.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
You go first.
You go first.
You make it sound so easy.
What's the B-G's?
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Naw. I bet'cha it's something better than air.
I didn't see nothing.
Sorry about today, man.
I don't know yet.
Nothing.
Out the door and to the left.
Still gonna smell it.
That ain't gonna work.
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You better stop running from that girl.
I ain't trying to get in it.
What's the matter?
$247.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
How can they do this?
You know what this is?
You walked?
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that.
So.
Why?
Yo know what? I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Who is that?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Restraining order? Where the hell you meet this girl?
What?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Just a little.
You straight?
She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper- sprayed me!
I can't see! I can't see! Daddy!
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center. I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you. 'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Go on and make yourself at home. I'mma go get dressed for work.
Man, this a cool house.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million. We bought this house and I spent the rest on this. It's the bomb, huh?
Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Naw, them dudes is assholes. Especially that dog - Cheeco. Watch this little ass, he's sneaky. Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I know; this a long way from Watts. But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen.
Yep. I forgot about him cussin' out everybody. Damn that was fun.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last? Up at the family reunion.
What's crackin'?
You alright?
Next time, page me first.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
It's locked.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation.
Yes I did. Excuse me.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Huh?
Most definitely.
It's cool. You ain't got to apologize for your brothers. They're big boys.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
What you mean, you don't know? Just wait here.
You want us to give you a ride?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together. Where you going?
+++$+++ Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go. Wife stays here, of course.
+++$+++ Okay, buddy. Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me. It's just a certified mail delivery.
+++$+++ Come on, jerky, you can tell me. Got a white wife, huh? Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for? You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
+++$+++ Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
+++$+++ Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
+++$+++ Delivery!
+++$+++ Delivery!
+++$+++ Smokin' what?
Yeah, pops!
Come on.
+++$+++ I saw it.
Have you seen Day-Day?
I'll remember.
Hey, Pops, I'm grown. Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
You coming in?
+++$+++ 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing. I still can't figure that one out.
+++$+++ Nice neighborhood, huh?
All damn.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I do.
+++$+++ It ain't about being a punk, son. It's about this...
+++$+++ That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something! That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
What's the matter?
Here I come!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
KYM +++$+++ Why for? Them boys are real player haters.
Nice to meet you?
KYM +++$+++ Strange activity. I think they running drugs off Tijuana. Day-Day don't believe me.
KYM +++$+++ Well, then, it's all good. Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street? I've been seeing a lot of activity.
KYM +++$+++ I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
KYM +++$+++ My name is Miss Ho Kym. Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass. Nice to meet you, Craig. Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
+++$+++ Bullshit! I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
+++$+++ I don't have no damn cover.
+++$+++ No, give me my damn money back. Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
+++$+++ I can't get jiggy with this shit. Where is the damn manager?
Call me.
Thanks for the help.
He's a boy, dude.
Bite his ear!
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
I don't know.
Ya'll live around here?
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. How y'all doing?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding. All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
You wanna knock?
Why did he go in the house?
Where's Craig?
Butterflies, my ass. I'm about to go home.
Are you out your mind? I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy. You must be crazy.
Let it go!
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I know.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
You could sell your Beamer.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Sorry, dude.
I do.
Today ain't my day.
Are they still out there?
What was that?
That the big one, huh?
What is it?
What it say?
Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Did you see that? That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited. But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired. You feel me?
Where's Craig?
I know. I'm sorry.
+++$+++ What?!
+++$+++ Ah damn. Damn.
20 minutes?
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community. By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Shut up! Where's that other miyatea?
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shut up! Both of you right now!
What?! This look like a 7-11 or something? Get the fuck outta here!
Nothing.
I don't know.
Good, let's get out.
Huh?
I don't know.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Debo! Debo!
You too big.
William.
Just do it.
If you shut up I'll tell you. The urgent message is...Drop everything! Craig is in trouble. Come quick, don't call.
Here's the plan. You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Yeah.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
I don't know, Debo.
Yeah, and hurry up.
Take your car.
Nothing. What you want?
Hey! I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later. Now get out of here. You're scaring our company.
I'll take you later.
+++$+++ Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
+++$+++ I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
+++$+++ My back.
+++$+++ Damn, big bro. You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
+++$+++ Need to lose some weight.
+++$+++ What about that ugly dog?
+++$+++ Willie, shut up. Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
+++$+++ I don't know. Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
+++$+++ Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
+++$+++ I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
+++$+++ Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro. He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby! This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent. Ain't that right, nephew?
+++$+++ For what? We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
+++$+++ Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
+++$+++ I threw my back, again.
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Mr. Nasty time?
+++$+++ What you doing to my nephew?
Okay. Bye, Craig.
Elroy.
Oooh, ba-by!
+++$+++ I've been a bad boy.
+++$+++ Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
+++$+++ That's my girl.
+++$+++ Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
+++$+++ Nothing. I broke a lamp.
+++$+++ Don't remind me.
+++$+++ What's he doing here?
+++$+++ It's an important speech.
Oh, yeah?
The grave. Somebody close?
Somebody close?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Huh?
Sorry.
San Diego.
Business.
Uh, yes..
What?
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Same to you.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Can we go now?
+++$+++ For not believing you.
+++$+++ I would also like to apologize.
+++$+++ Indeed.
+++$+++ I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
+++$+++ I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
+++$+++ I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
+++$+++ What the hell are you saying?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Who did?
+++$+++ You shot her?
+++$+++ How do you know that?
+++$+++ You were very nervous.
+++$+++ I remember you...in the elevator.
+++$+++ Ah.
+++$+++ That's...a comfort to hear.
+++$+++ One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
+++$+++ My security people are right next door.
+++$+++ Of course. I wish everything were that easy.
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ You were saying? Your daughter....?
+++$+++ What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
I want'to talk to her.
Let me talk to her again.
+++$+++ That's right. That gives you...
No, please...
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
+++$+++ That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
I kill her - and you kill me.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
I killed you.
You killed him.
How should I...?
He's dead?
What...?
What would you do in my place?
+++$+++ You get another chance in ten minutes.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
The gun...
+++$+++ I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
+++$+++ This'11 get you in anywhere. Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
This says "invitation only".
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
+++$+++ Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
+++$+++ What's your point?
+++$+++ She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
+++$+++ This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Yes, yes, I understand.
+++$+++ Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
+++$+++ Daddy?
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
+++$+++ Come with us, sir.
+++$+++ You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
What?
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I think you're right.
Okay...
But...
Are you sure?
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
No, that's,..that's fine
No, kisses to...
No...kisses to you.
I promise.
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I know you do, honey.
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Right.
Let' s do it.
Ready?
No way.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Thanks for the tip.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
What are you going to do now?
Well?
What am I supposed to say to her?
You're going to go see her.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Irene is going to help.
Meet Irene.
Keep the change.
Yeah, now listen. I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Yeah, all right, listen...
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Kill the Governor.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
That's right.
What?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Oh, man...
I remember. The big tipper.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Keep it.
Keep it.
Is within himself.
I said I have to do something.
I have to do something.
I'm just an accountant.
+++$+++ Fuck you!
+++$+++ Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
+++$+++ Hey!
+++$+++ Fuckin' A.
+++$+++ I don't have to pay you nothin'.
+++$+++ For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
+++$+++ No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
+++$+++ I don't want my windshield cleaned.
+++$+++ Could I see it?
+++$+++ Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
A surprise?
Why?
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
Where are we going?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
I've done much better ones than this.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
+++$+++ It goes in that little hole.
+++$+++ This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Everybody does?
+++$+++ No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
+++$+++ It's time. It's time now.
+++$+++ Get moving.
+++$+++ Where is he? Did you lose him?
+++$+++ Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
+++$+++ It's under control.
+++$+++ Yeah.
+++$+++ Just put her on.
+++$+++ Put her on.
+++$+++ Come Back.
+++$+++ Yeah.
+++$+++ That's enough.
+++$+++ You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. Do it.
+++$+++ Only you.
+++$+++ I kill her anyway.
+++$+++ Come with me, honey.
+++$+++ Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
+++$+++ Young love.
+++$+++ Right there.
+++$+++ I'm looking for them.
+++$+++ Keep your eyes peeled.
+++$+++ Nah. Hates his wife.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
No.
He carried on some; kicked.
No.
+++$+++ Keep talkin', Preacher.
+++$+++ Keep talkin', Preacher.
+++$+++ I'll bet.
+++$+++ What religion do you profess, Preacher?
+++$+++ You, Preacher?
+++$+++ How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
+++$+++ Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
+++$+++ That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
+++$+++ Hm!
+++$+++ What'd I say? What? What? What? What?
+++$+++ Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
+++$+++ And I won't never tell about the money.
+++$+++ I will guard Pearl with my life...
+++$+++ Not even her?
+++$+++ Yes, Dad.
+++$+++ Dad, you're bleeding...
+++$+++ Listen to me John.
+++$+++ Where's your Mom?
+++$+++ Don't!
+++$+++ If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
+++$+++ Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
+++$+++ Do you mind me cussin', boy?
+++$+++ Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
+++$+++ Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
+++$+++ Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
+++$+++ Just fine.
+++$+++ O, she's all right.
+++$+++ When'll the skiff be ready?
+++$+++ When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
+++$+++ Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
+++$+++ Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
+++$+++ Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
She went.
They hid in a broom closet!
+++$+++ It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
+++$+++ John: you go fetch Ruby. Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
+++$+++ Here's what you owe me. One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
+++$+++ Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
+++$+++ The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
+++$+++ And the Lord told that man --
Yes! Yes!
AAA-MENN!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Tricked us!
Come on!
+++$+++ And he killed every last one of 'em!
+++$+++ Bluebeard!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
What can we do, Mother?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Just went?
+++$+++ Mr. Powell! Willa has run away!
+++$+++ Sshhh! He's in there.
Mother, I only --
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
+++$+++ Plan on a longer visit next time.
+++$+++ It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
+++$+++ That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
+++$+++ Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
+++$+++ You'll come right out and ask that Man of God! Mr. Paow-well! Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
+++$+++ I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ What he needs is a dose o' salts!
+++$+++ Pearl dotes on him.
+++$+++ If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
+++$+++ That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
+++$+++ Icey, I don't want a husband.
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
+++$+++ Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
+++$+++ I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar. She was drinking.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
+++$+++ Amen.
+++$+++ Ah.
+++$+++ What could have possessed that girl!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
+++$+++ Amen! Amen!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
+++$+++ Are we goin' home, John?
+++$+++ Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
+++$+++ John, where are we g --
+++$+++ Hush, Pearl. Come on.
+++$+++ It'll spoil our supper.
+++$+++ I'm hungry, John.
+++$+++ Where are we goin', John?
+++$+++ Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
+++$+++ Yes, I reckon that's it.
+++$+++ She's gone to Moundsville.
+++$+++ Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
+++$+++ John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
+++$+++ You what?
+++$+++ You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
+++$+++ You swore, Pearl!
+++$+++ Hm?
+++$+++ Sshhh...
+++$+++ 'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
+++$+++ The Blue Men?
+++$+++ Tell me a story, John.
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ Hing, hang, hung.
+++$+++ Who's them Blue Men yonder?
+++$+++ There! What's so hard about that!
+++$+++ A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
+++$+++ I'll make coffee.
+++$+++ He ain't my Dad.
+++$+++ Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
+++$+++ Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
+++$+++ Story, honey? Why, what story?
+++$+++ Up river.
+++$+++ Dead.
+++$+++ John, where's your folks?
+++$+++ I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage. You-all have your work cut out!
+++$+++ Don't you hurt her!
+++$+++ Nothin'.
+++$+++ Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Now: Where?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
+++$+++ Don't you believe me?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
All right... Come along.
All right boy: where's the money?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
+++$+++ I don't know nothin'!
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
+++$+++ Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
+++$+++ It -- she --
+++$+++ Getting Pearl to bed. I --
+++$+++ No. No.
+++$+++ Nothin'!
+++$+++ You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
+++$+++ You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
+++$+++ Huh?
+++$+++ Is that all?
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Why, pray tell?
About our secrets.
+++$+++ Can I have milk too?
+++$+++ Can I have my supper please?
+++$+++ I'm hungry.
+++$+++ John's bad.
+++$+++ All right.
+++$+++ Tell me another secret about my Dad.
+++$+++ Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
What's your name?
+++$+++ That's no secret. I'm five.
+++$+++ What secret shall I tell?
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ Mm-hm.
Ahh!
Ahhh. And is there -- a doll?
What's their names?
No. No one never did.
O' course.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
She turned me out of the bed.
Our honeymoon.
Yes; from the first night.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
+++$+++ Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
+++$+++ It's not in the river, is it Harry?
+++$+++ I'm through, Harry.
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ I -- no, I --
Get up.
Get up, Willa.
+++$+++ No, Harry! I thought --
+++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
+++$+++ Harry!
+++$+++ John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
+++$+++ John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
None of your business, Madam.
Them kids!
Didn't you hear me, boy?
+++$+++ What's wrong, John?
The Lord will provide.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
My flesh and blood!
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
+++$+++ It's about that John and that Pearl?
+++$+++ How'do.
The man! The man!
Miz Cooper!
Pearl and John.
+++$+++ He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
+++$+++ Now who was this?
I been out with men.
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
This man down at the Drugstore...
You'll whip me!
I been bad!
Pearl and John!
Oh my god, oh my god...
How can you tell?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
+++$+++ Okay, good. She's asleep.
+++$+++ Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
+++$+++ How long's this been going on?
+++$+++ Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
I sure as hell hope so.
No, nothing.
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
My dream.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
The killer.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to. Listen, I... I know who he is.
Much better.
Hi.
Well what you reading it for?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Okay, okay. I think.
It's nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
You believe in anything?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night?
Haven't slept, have you?
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Yeah. Something slippery all over here... Tina?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Who was scary?
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night. In each others' arms like we always said.
It's just a stupid cat.
Worked like a charm.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
+++$+++ Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
+++$+++ Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
+++$+++ Sure, but...
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
+++$+++ Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
+++$+++ Hello Nancy.
Dad -- what you doing here?
You don't know he did it.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
+++$+++ What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
She dreamed this would happen...
Rod's not a lunatic.
+++$+++ How you doing, pal?
+++$+++ Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
+++$+++ Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
She lived there.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
+++$+++ What's the Coroner got to say?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
+++$+++ Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
+++$+++ Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
+++$+++ Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
+++$+++ Krueger.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Give me the key, mother.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
Your father the cop. That's a good one. Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Dead and gone.
S'curity.
Nancy!
Put that damned thing down!
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Okay.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Nancy?
Right.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
To bed with you, c'mon.
You okay?
It happens all the time. I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed? I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
I will.
I won't.
Right home after. See you.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
Where you think you're going?
It wasn't that serious...
No.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
No.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
And then what happened?
Someone else was there.
I never touched her.
The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
What you dream?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Nice to have a fire.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?
He's nuts about you.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
No more fights?
You feel better now, right?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
RUSSIANS +++$+++ From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
It's from Paris.
RUSSIANS +++$+++ Naturally, Comrade.
RUSSIANS +++$+++ Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Have you any money?
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
You want this?
What is it, Anna?
You feel it, though.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Yes.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
A dress you wear in the evening.
An evening gown.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Well, a hat...
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
I see.
You should. I'll show you.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
And you too, Ninotchka.
I'll tell you later. That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
An omelet.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination. In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises...
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
That's her.
No, that's not him...
Are we free, Buljanoff?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look... The service in this hotel is terrible! See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
What a lovely room you have here.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Misha! Misha!
We don't like Razinin.
He's cutting our throat...
Capitalistic methods...
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Monsieur.
No, no.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
We have opened a restaurant...
Shall we tell her?
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
But, Comrades...
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
With two f's, if you please.
Yes, Comrade?
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
Which lawyer?
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
How are things in Moscow?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
The former Duchess!
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
That's all right.
Good morning, Gaston.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
No, sir.
No, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Eight forty-two, sir.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Go to bed.
Good evening, Monsieur.
+++$+++ Certainly.
+++$+++ Yes.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
That's perfect!
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Good evening, Your Highness.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
Let's do that.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Leon, my little boy.
Yes, Leon...
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
We can call our ambassador.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
We can wait.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
No, no.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Razinin.
I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Look for yourselves.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Brave... that's right.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A week?
How much does this cost?
Comrade.
Comrade.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Yes, monsieur.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Yes, monsieur?
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
What's new?
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
We may have a chance.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
...and Kopalski.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Even the swallows are back.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Well, we're back home.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please? Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State. You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
We did our best, Comrade.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
No, thank you.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Au revoir.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story... It still makes me laugh. It is very funny. I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
You want me to go in there?
What can I do about it?
Give me another double brandy.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Why should I take a chance?
You're going to force us... huh?
Oh no. No visa.
No visa.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
I think so too.
But you had!
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
You believe in our cause?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
What business?
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice.
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read. It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
So happy and so tired.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry? Let us be happy... give us our moment.... We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. Can I make a speech now?
Is this the wish of the masses?
They belong to the people.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Who cried that one?
...but big.
But I can throw it out of the window.
No, no music.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Radio! What is radio?
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Much happier.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished. I want to confess, darling.
Our salute will be a kiss.
...and we won't clench our fist...
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Not white, darling.
Are we going to build our little house?
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No speech?
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
I must talk to my brothers!
Comrades! Comrades!
Thursday.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
You must, darling.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
A funny story?
And General Savitzky.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast. To us, Ninotchka!
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
My darling.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
Ninotchka, I love you.
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
Did you make any change in this room?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
No... go on.
You see I couldn't shout that.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!... But he got you here.
You see? Life can be so simple.
You remember this room?
I don't look too foolish?
Yes.
Yes.
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
Not funny, huh?
I don't think so.
No.
So do I. Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
Do you like Scotch stories?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
Because we are an odd couple.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Just smile.
Will you smile?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice. When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Must one always be after something?
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
This is a place for workmen.
Then how did you get here?
I don't like your following me.
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
Room service speaking.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Then do it through my lawyer!
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
As a representative of Moscow...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I must go.
Oh, let it ring.
Glorious, analytical...
Thank you.
Was that talkative?
It's false sentimentality.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's twelve o'clock.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Wounded? How?
The bayonet? Did you really?
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
Thank you.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Ni-notchka.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Thank you. Thank you.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
We take off our hat and coat. We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile. Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Good evening, comrade. This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Then why don't we go? You might be an interesting subject of study.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
So that is your house?
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you. As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Yes, it is.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
That's a strange angle.
Go ahead.
Your type will soon be extinct.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Suppress it.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
And where are we?
Why do you need my finger?
How long does it take a man to land?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
You might hold this for me.
You're welcome.
No.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
What?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Gladly.
Me?
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
That does it, Swana. Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Now, please, Swana.
Hello.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Has done what?
What is this, Swana?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Yes.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
No thanks, Swana.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree. The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
I'm going, Leon... but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier. You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday. You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Yes, Swana.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
Thank you.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
You can't imagine.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her. She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Not in your condition. Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit. Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much. You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Shhh! ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon! ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Did I hear something about jewels?
Oh, yes.
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Now, Swana...
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Oh, Leon!
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
Did you win?
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Hello, Leon!
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Go on.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
Madame, if you...
I must ask you to leave.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
We have nothing to discuss.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous! Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
Good morning.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
That depends on the tip.
Well... that's my business, madame.
May I have your bags, madame?
Here, please...
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I don't understand.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Yes... leaving immediately.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur. This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here... "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
Cigarette?
May I ask why?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Yes.
Yes, it does.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
+++$+++ That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu.
+++$+++ But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
+++$+++ Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
+++$+++ I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
+++$+++ This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps? Or a nice little corner table?
Where is it?
Where is that?
Where do you eat?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Your Highness.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory. Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this? Raising a dirty mouth!
We could check the tape again, sir.
You did say it, sir.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia. The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Yeah? Well, I own the fucking casino.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
We'll see about that ...
How's the job coming, Bob?
No. His office. I want a very private conversation. I don't want to be bugged.
So ... let's go ...
Where the hell is he?
Good. You know how I feel about loyalty. I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail. That I promise you. The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John. I have complete confidence in you.
John, you don't want to start down that road. I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night." This is beyond you or even me. It's the country, John. It's the presidency.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
We have nothing to hide. But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth. That is the incredible thing!
He's right. Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John. A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate. What do we have to hide?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore. There's a cancer on the presidency. And it's growing. With every day that ...
I'm still not confident we can ride through this. Some people are going to have to go to jail. Hunt's not the only problem. Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments. Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
Uh huh ...
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
I like that. That's a solution.
What?
Pay him. Pay him what he wants.
Son of a bitch.
Then what about this Washington Post crap? Woodwind and Fernstein?
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John? This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences! There were no weapons. Right? No injuries. There was no success! It's just ridiculous.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect. He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
To protect his people.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Is it?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day. The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Yeah?
I figured that out.
You think this is just about politics?
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob. Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list. You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Why me?
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking. He's the one ...
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
And what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center? Lyndon bugged! So did Kennedy! FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me? What about Lyndon? He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down. Did anyone talk to him?
Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
My point exactly! Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything. Do you see me screwing everything that moves? For Christ's sake! I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do! I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China! So why are these cocksuckers turning on me? Because they don't like the way I look. Where I went to school.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit! You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
No, you didn't, Bob.
The country's loving it.
He's begging for a meeting, chief. He wants to go overseas for awhile.
He's in the dumps, sir. Agnew. Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
The soldiers were provoked. The students started it, for Christ's sake!
I thought the gloves were off.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Why not?
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over. These aren't fraternity pranks, John. It's anarchy. A revolution!
No, sir.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay? In ... hundreds? Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman? Screwing with the CIA? I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
Pay him.
And?
Where's Hunt now?
Is it legal? I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Well, he's photogenic. Let's try dog bones?
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Who? Not another goddamn Cuban?
I don't have time for all this shit! Just handle it, Bob! Keep it out of the White House. What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again.
McCord? ...
Mitchell?
Jesus! Through a window?
Jesus! Did Mitchell know?
That smell. I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter. I am that blood, General. I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al. I got soft. You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times. Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means. They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
We can't survive this, sir. They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
That was civil war.
The army?
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
Can we get around this, Al?
It's totally out of context. I was protecting the national security. I never intended --
So?
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first. And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
Richardson won't do that. He'll resign.
Cox! Fire him.
A dozen? I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys. I'll take my chances with the Senate.
For what?!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is? I never made a dime from public office! I'm honest. My dad died broke. You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Let 'em try! I appointed three of those bastards! I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
It's the President's personal property! I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
That's what they're doing.
'Night, Al.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Damn right. And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it? They wanna believe in the President.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people. No one I know feels ... close to you.
May I say something, Mr. President?
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
... go on.
It's marked. Also there's June twenty third. And this year -- March twenty first. Those are the ones ...
Sir ... six bodies.
No ...
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Townsend gave us 300 grand. Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
I promised Iran to Townsend.
What about the documents he promised?
When I met with him, he said ...
We could leverage Helms.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing. It's out of control ... You might burden just me with this in the future.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker! He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Why would they?! Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway? Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things. They come to Jew York City and they buy up things. One of the things they buy is the New York Times. And you know what? Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
Because they're not Americans.
My God, my God! He talked to the New York Times?
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia. It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
And his staff. Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
Sir?
What?
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ... Don't forget to be on God's side.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I. We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit. That's top priority.
It's the parents' fault really.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob. They've had it too soft. Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Get that little fucker! Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious. Why're we stopping?
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked. Now stop this pussyfooting around. Dead kids! How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this? I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists. Like Chambers and Hiss.
Money. Follow the money.
They had us bugged. Christ, he had everybody bugged. Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me. That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Alright. But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
So? You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead. If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Jesus!
Before?! Eisenhower approved that?
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2. In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion. Track 2 ... it was our idea. We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro. So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead? The Mafia, the money people. So we put together Track 2 ...
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster. He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
He wasn't protecting me. He was putting me on notice.
Cue the crowd. Go to the woman's group. Get the bald guy, he's great ...
Dick, you don't have to make a statement. Herb covered it for you.
The bastard! If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won. He made me look soft.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America. We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral. The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
No, no, not tonight. Don't let her in here. I have too much to do.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob. We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes. The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own. Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world. Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
How is this national security?
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
He'll need a pretext. He'll never figure one out for himself.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up. How does that threaten us?
All right.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman. He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you. But ...
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old. And for God's sake, keep Colson out. It's time to baptize our young counsel. That means Dean can never talk about it. Attorney-client privilege. Get to it. And Dean -- you stay close on this.
We'll work on it. I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
"National Priority."
"Security" is not strong enough.
Silence!
What do you mean, sir?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
We were working on China.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke. They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Definitely. Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House? No shit! This is goddamn Disneyland! Since when?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut. He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper. You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen? He wanted to buy a damned fire truck! Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard. Strength in this life. Happiness in the next.
It's meant to make us stronger. Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur. God has chosen thee to survive ...
It's a gift, Richard. This law school is a gift from your brother.
I can't ...
We haven't said grace yet. Richard.
Then this shall be our little secret. Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees. Thou may fool the world. Even thy father. But not me, Richard. Never me.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
So am I. Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Yes, Mother ...
Why me?
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Go to law school. Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Oh, no, Harold. He doesn't respond well to humor. Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
What'd you say?
What'd he say?
No.
No. They make me sick. They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young. But let me tell you, there are worse things than death. There is such a thing as evil.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency. But I would never, never consider ... His death was awful, an awful thing for this country. Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
It is not my practice to spy on the president. Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality. Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba. But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Mr. Castro.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
And of course I accept. I'm flattered. And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
And me? ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces. You could do the same ...
Diem? Trujillo? Lumumba? Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
My friends call me "Mister President."
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock? I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Kennedy -- never. He'll fry in hell for what he did to me. But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
Not Joaquin, you idiot. Nixon. Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar? Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself." All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Yeah, you do. I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office. He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Kissinger?
Who do you think is behind it?
We took his system out.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar. They're stealing papers right out of his office.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar. They've been at it now for a year. Young kids just like Tricia. I don't know. Do you think they have a point, Edgar? Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
I know ...
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star. They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
I know you've been very careful not to. That's why I'm concerned.
Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment. Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
You should ask Bobby.
Oh, my goodness ...
Winning?
Turn this crap off, Clyde. It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you. My father sold it before they found oil on it.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
A guy named Gordon Liddy. Thinks he's Martin Borman. You wanna meet him?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank. We're gonna plug a leak.
The White House.
They're around.
How the fuck did you know?
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Remember -- listen up! Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration. Check yourselves. Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys. We rendezvous where? The Watergate, Room 214. When? At zero three-hundred.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow. It keeps me calm. I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Presidents don't threaten. They don't have to. Good day, gentlemen.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
What do you mean, Jack?
It's nobody's fault, Jack. It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead. Things change.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46. Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war. We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks. Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
So, what's this about, Dick?
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow. Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Dick, these boys want you to run. They're serious. They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column. That would've done it in '60.
Agreed.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini? Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal. We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Her name's Sandy ...
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Party ain't started yet, Dick. Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
If they harass you, I, too, will resign. And I will tell the world why.
They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions. History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Idiotic? Yes, I suppose it was.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing. You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Housecleaning? It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
That's right! And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed! Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Exactly, sir. That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry. What do you think?
But they all got it back again, didn't they? We should have lunch sometime.
Finally someone who's noticed! I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon. You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment. You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public! And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way. Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
No, Henry. I don't.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times. Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard? He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Fuck it! He doesn't like me, John! It's your fault, Henry.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation. We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve. And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
I don't know. He made me see the stars ...
Yes.
He was a politician.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Yes, Mr. President.
Of course.
I was asleep, Mr. President. What can I get you?
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
I was the lesser of two evils.
That has the added virtue of being true.
Don't ever trust them. They never tell the truth or honor their commitments. Vietnamese are like Russians. Both are dogs.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Kissinger's misunderstood. He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Free, if you're the president.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife. I'm out of politics.
Get off that. That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks. They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes. I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John. Tuberculosis got him.
How do you know that, John? Did we try? Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em? What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts. Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
Jesus Christ!
How many?
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
That'll be the day.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
What the hell -- I love her. And she's great in bed.
It's a thing she does. She talks at night.
Sorry, Dick. She's a little tipsy.
Hiss was protecting his wife. I've always believed that.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
The lie?
It was illegal, what he did.
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
... Use his women.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Edgar, wonderful to see you. Clyde ... hi.
But it was all we had.
... give me a break, Mary.
+++$+++ Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us. It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
+++$+++ What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
+++$+++ Ernie Davis.
+++$+++ Syracuse.
+++$+++ You're shittin' me.
She must be very attractive. Would she like an autograph? She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like? I mean, what kind of clothes do you like? Do you like blue ... red?
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Hi.
+++$+++ It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
+++$+++ Then what's the point? What's the point of being president? You're powerless.
+++$+++ Someone wants it ... You can't stop it, can you? Even if you wanted to. Because it's not you. It's the system. And the system won't let you stop it ...
+++$+++ No, we don't! You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you? My brother died over there last November. Why? What good was his death?
+++$+++ We didn't come here to talk about football. We came here to end the war.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
And this?! Good Lord, have you lost your mind? Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
No, sir ...
Fire him.
Of them.
Proud?
So I'm supposed to be ...
What's in there?
That's right.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me. Then it's a question of mathematics. How many votes do we have in the Senate?
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Bernstein.
No, they want you, Mr. President. I really think it would be a good move.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything! I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset. That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing. I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
We got the press this time!
No ... it's just going to start now ... If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
No. They're not yours. They are you. You should burn them.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years. What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
I remember Alger Hiss. I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything. But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them. Because you have absolutely no remorse. No concept of remorse. You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you? Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick? Sex? Your secrets, your fantasies? Or just me and you and ...
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Thank you? Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
No, it isn't. I won't interfere with you anymore. I'm finished trying.
I'm the only left, Dick. If you don't talk to me, you ...
Hiding what?
And what am I doing?
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling. But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
When?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
You're a long way from Whittier.
Penny for your thoughts.
No, I don't. I'm not Jack ...
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
You personally?
They're all your enemies?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
No, you're not. So stop comparing yourself to him. You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it. Why can't you just enjoy it?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick? Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys? You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us.
I've missed you.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?" And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy! Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Then I'll be there for you.
And then you'll be happy?
Do you really want this, Dick?
I need you out there. It won't be like last time. The war's crippled the Democrats. I can win ... We deserve it. Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last. Nobody knows better than you. Frank Nixon's boy.
They love you, Buddy. They need you, too.
Buddy? ...
Were you planning to tell me?
No. It's his way. He hates me. Him and Teddy. They always hated me.
De Gaulle's gonna be there. And Macmillan. And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
I'll never run again. I promise.
Yeah ... I'm out.
I'll do it. No more.
We can be happy. We really can. We love you, Dick. The girls and I...
Dick, don't...
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it? They want to drive us apart. To beat us. We can't let them do it. We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake! I'm political. And you're political, too!
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
My God -- divorce? What about the girls?
What are you saying? What are you talking about?
I'll concede in the morning.
Amen to that.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died? Nothing. He was so damned honest ... But I miss him. I miss him a hell of a lot.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy? Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight. He was a failure, too.
What do you mean? We worked for it. We earned it. It's ours.
It's not fair, Buddy. I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing. I hate it.
It's hard to lose ...
We lost ...
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons. We have similar views on the balance of power ...
The Republican Party was never home to extremists. You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
What?
Write. You know, a book. I'm calling it "Six Crises." It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Lost.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it. I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Hi, Happy. Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Well enough. You're looking "happy," Nelson.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
You're discouraged.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
When did he die?
Yes I do.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
How come're you doin that?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
That man that shot you died in prison.
How fresh is this coffee?
Want a cup?
Didn't know there was any.
I am older.
How you been, Ellis?
How many a those things you got now?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
You heard it?
How'd you know I was here.
Hard to believe.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Oh yes.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Uh-huh.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs. It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Carla Jean...
+++$+++ Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
+++$+++ If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
+++$+++ Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
I don't know. My mind wanders.
+++$+++ He can take all comers.
+++$+++ He won't neither. He never has.
+++$+++ Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
+++$+++ Who's he in trouble with then?
+++$+++ Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
+++$+++ Not word one.
+++$+++ No I ain't.
+++$+++ Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Yessir.
How's that, Sheriff?
You gonna drive out there?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Yessir.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
No sir.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
Well I don't either!
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Wasn't no bullet?
What was the bullet?
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
...Now that's aggravating.
So when was he here?
That from the lock?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
What about yours?
We goin' in?
No. Probably I don't.
That's possible.
I don't know...
Mm.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
That's the boy.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
You sure?
Uh-huh.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...This month's checks.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
...How'd you sleep?
I mean, would you care to join me.
What do you think.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Don't hurt no one.
Don't get hurt.
...Be careful.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I thought it was a car afire.
Well I didn't see it.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
Yes. Things fall into place.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
To your husband.
No. But I gave my word.
+++$+++ ...I need to sit down.
+++$+++ What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
+++$+++ I ain't got the money.
+++$+++ She'll be all right?
+++$+++ Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
+++$+++ Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
What makes you say that?
What did you tell him?
You know what's goin' on?
Hey.
I shall return.
Yes ma'am?
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
You should be used to that.
Uh-huh.
Well I got a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Yes I do.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
+++$+++ Well -- how come?
+++$+++ Why would we go to Odessa?
Well then I'll tell her myself.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Goin' out.
Yeah.
That'll work.
Just keep it up.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
What? Quit hollerin'.
No. I found it.
At the gettin' place.
+++$+++ That'll be the day.
+++$+++ What's in the satchel?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
You go to hell.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
And where is that.
What's that.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know where the money is.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Hello?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Yes I did.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Well -- where ya goin'?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
You from around here?
No me mate.
All right...
...You getting anything on this?
...Where's the transponder?
Mm-hm.
Huh? What is...
What's this about?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
All right.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.
Why would I care where you're going.
I don't need to talk to you.
You know who it is.
CHAIR +++$+++ I see.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Yes.
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Everything.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Just call it.
Yes.
Call it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
Yes I do.
Well... I need to close now --
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...What time do you go to bed.
Sir?
Generally around dark. At dark.
Now. We close now.
Yessir.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Will there be anything else?
With anything?
Is somethin' wrong?
...Will there be somethin' else?
I was just passin' the time.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I seen you was from Dallas.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Sixty-nine cent.
No sir, it's unusual.
Okay.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
The kind with the most poles.
Never mind. I want a tent.
Somethin' like that.
Uh-huh.
They'll give you a wallop.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
I want you to take me to another motel.
It's all right.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
What room?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Yes?
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
What do you want to know?
Well enough.
Okay.
Yessir.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
When did you last see him.
I do like you.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
What else then?
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I got beers in my room.
That's got two double beds.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty. It ain't took.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Could I get another room.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
The what?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No. You don't.
The heroin. You don't have it.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
So was I.
Were you in Nam?
Pot metal?
I don't mean braze.
Cast iron?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
What did you do?
...What do you do?
I been immobile.
Not any way.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I know how he found me.
Sugar?
How would you describe him?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
Yes sir. Two tours.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Yes sir.
No sir.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
I don't know.
You do, I reckon.
I don't know. American citizens.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight. Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
So she did witness it?
Could I have that in American?
How is she?
Sheriff, I don't...
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
YOU shut up! They're beautiful, but get them some water.
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night. Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Any idea where it is?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
That's a nice name for what you need...
No, I didn't have to.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I know that...
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Tell him what you told me.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
We think we know where Betty is.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday. That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
A woman can write a check.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Junior year!
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You think a woman did that?!
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
It wasn't a woman.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
...you are so goddamn weird. Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette... It's no big deal, Betty.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column? I'll take a refill there, Betty...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Hmm. So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
They're fine... you miss it?
Oh. How come?
No, I was just... How you doing?
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will. He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
...what're you saying?
I'd rather not...
This is really awkward...
I better go check on them.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I'm sorry.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine... Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea... I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think? You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Wait. Let me get this out. I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
I am?
...to see you.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
Do you know why I'm here?
Do you know who I am?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
+++$+++ Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
+++$+++ You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone. Is that issue?
Yes, ma'am.
+++$+++ Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
+++$+++ ...I don't think I know that hospital.
+++$+++ Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
+++$+++ Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
I gotta go.
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
+++$+++ Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy. Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
+++$+++ Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
+++$+++ Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
+++$+++ Well, you are.
+++$+++ All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
+++$+++ Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
+++$+++ Let me know if you need anything, okay?
+++$+++ Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
+++$+++ Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ The LeSabre!
+++$+++ Aahhh... So what color is it?
+++$+++ You sure? Maybe next week we could...
+++$+++ I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
+++$+++ Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
+++$+++ Oh, Betty --
+++$+++ Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
...George. I do. My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I... ...I'm sorry.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Why are you doing this to me?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Ad lib?
Yes... maybe it was.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life... I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know... ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
Didn't I?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
I don't think your friend likes me.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
What happened when you were twelve?
You told me that two hours ago.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Lyla's very nice.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
I guess we all did. You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Why do they keep calling you George?
You never gave us a chance...
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Oh, you mean Fred.
That's very kind of you.
I beg your pardon?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
They're new to us...
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Oh, I know. So, who're these clients?
I got you, Del...
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
...like the water purifiers?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Sure you don't want any salad?
What was that?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
So, call me when you --
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Roy! What are you doing here?
It was Chloe...
Yes.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
What're you doing here, Roy?
Uh-huh.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You made out alright.
Like Rome?
I'll go to the Hospital.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Dr. David Ravell.
How did you know?
No. Loma Vista.
Oh. I mean, except for that. Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
I left my husband two days ago.
That's horrible!
Sure I loved it! It was great.
I should call you Dorothy. When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Where you headed, Betty?
I'd slap his face.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
What's the matter here?
She called you 'George,' George.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it... But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I have to leave now.
...this is your sweater, right?
What are you doing?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
You should have a little faith in people.
Rosa...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, almost never.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Does he know you think he's real?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You never know who you'll see.
Umm...
What are those for?
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!! You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
What? Where was he?!
Who?
I was talking about what you could wear!
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that? "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever... One of us should.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories... We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie. His wife.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy... So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
The Five?
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
The one you were telling me about?
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
It's something I had to do. For David.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
You don't sound like you're from here.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
You're hurting him!!
What are you doing?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
No, that should be more than --
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Really. And where was that, old man?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
The fuck you talking about?
Huh?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it? They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours. So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Like what?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Could you give us an example?
What do you mean?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
If we're for real?
Ahh... my wife's.
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
Not her mouth... I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
You made your point... I was wrong.
I said 'got it?'
Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
It just didn't fit her profile...
A doctor on the show... why?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
I need to get my goddamn head examined. You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
I'm not telling.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..." Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
We should go.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
That was a really shitty thing to do.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
Worse... you're in Texas.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
Half.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay? "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
...among others.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry... ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
What the hell was that, another statement?
Should I kill him now?
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
It's not here. Let's go.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
He told us it's in the Buick.
That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here... Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
Hell of a way to die.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That's what I thought. You better give me another example.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Wesley... Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Beer, please.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
What do you mean?
Betty was a lovely child.
This is Betty at twelve.
Thank you for your cooperation. Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
I see. May I?
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
...and how long did she work here?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Jesus Christ!
Really?
Seems like a nice place.
Isn't that the point?
What'd you get her?
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Is there a problem, George?
What the hell's going on?
...yeah.
Hmm?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Can I have an evil twin?
She's even taken a job as a nurse! David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party. But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Sure.
Oh fuck...
Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person?
Yeah? The sport utility?
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Would you say she was ambitious?
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
What did you say?
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small... I should have never come back here after college.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Loma Vista? You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
You lie, motherfucker...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Did Chloe crack?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Huh?
Yeah?
+++$+++ I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
+++$+++ "A Reason to Love."
+++$+++ No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
+++$+++ No. Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
+++$+++ I wish I could help you, but I can't.
+++$+++ No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
+++$+++ And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
+++$+++ Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
You can't do this - we just been pardoned! By the Governer himself!
Hang on there -
You can't do this -
Waitaminute -
Waitaminute -
Good Lord, what do we do?
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys. Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Do not seek the treasure!
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
That's right!
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Oh, okay.
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
'N turned into a frog -
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Okay, Everett.
Not that I'm aware.
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him. The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon. These things-
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Whuhh...
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Yeah, look at me.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Izzat right?
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too! Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Gopher, Everett?
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
Fire! I hate fire!
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Problem a p'seption.
Okay, Pappy.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Vernon Waldrip.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Helluva awgazation.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
I counted to three, honey.
Yes, but honey -
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
You -
You said -
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Not your...
- in the gods - Huh?
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's right, honey.
No weddin'.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring! You said you'd changed!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Now Penny, stop that!
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip. I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
But...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Aw, that's all right.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Isn't it, uh...
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Million point two.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway. And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
So I borrowed it till I did know!
Who was fixing to betray us!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Don't I know it.
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Who's the honcho around here?
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Buyin' nipples!
He's a suitor!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
Blooey!
He ain't our daddy!
Naw. That's over with.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Who gave you this idea?
Why?
You... in the Navy?
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Neither have you, pard!
Hi, Byron.
Thank you, sir!
What for?
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Great.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Yes, Sir.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest.
Good morning, girls.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
I don't mean anything by it.
A long time ago.
Yes, Joe.
Come over here where I can see you.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Well, goodbye.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Yes, sir!
Aw screw it...
It's important, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Yes, sir!
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Pity you don't have the character.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Why? Because you can do it alone?
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
I'm doing okay, sir.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
What's your name, boy?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
What did you call me, Mayo?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
No, sir.
No, sir!
No, sir.
No.
I didn't call you anything before that.
I called you Sarge.
Pardon?
How're you doing, Sarge?
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Louder!
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Yes I do!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Sid, there's no baby.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
You what?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
How late?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Or we could do that yeah.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
You're sure it's okay?
Something tells me you've been here before.
I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
Yeah.
He was. He died.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
No! That's not true!
God help you, Lynette!
Lynette, where's Sid?
No. I never feel like that.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No way... Would you?
What do you mean?
I haven't made up my mind.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
He ask you out for next weekend?
How did it go with you guys?
Everything was different.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Great.
I got my foot on the floor.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
One more minute.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Well, excuse me for livin'!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
That's brilliant.
I bet you do!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Because he's my friend, too.
I'd like to come with you.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why'd he do it?
So?
I know that.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
No, they're for your mom.
Hi.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
What's the matter?
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Does it still hurt?
God.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'll get it if you want.
It sure was.
Any time, sailor.
I've never had a girl.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
I know who you are and what you want.
I'm starving.
You stayed after all.
Be a friend. Leave.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
There's always a choice.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
I vote for the motel.
Who cares? Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour. When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Not me.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Really?
Seriously.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
He said he grew up poor?
Yeah. All week long.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
I can't risk it.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own. I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Sid, what happened?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
It's mine.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But it can't wait.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died. I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Thanks for covering for me.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
That isn't true, is it?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Hey, you guys still awake?
You okay?
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Shhhh...
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Could you believe those girls!
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Jets.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Not that one.
You know how this gotta end.
The kid in here. The other two when we come out.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one. Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
You finish. Then we finish.
That's their problem.
She better.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them. Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Are you gonna open the safe?
Yeah. She can. She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid. Half an hour.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. I gotta check something.
Okay, okay! Okay.
I can't just...
This is ridiculous...
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
You can. You're full of ideas. You just need to squeeze one out.
What do you think? Get us into that room.
Please...
Yes.
Burning me. It's burning my eye.
Me. I am.
Stop it! Stop it!
The fuck did you do that for?!
Just sending a message. She'll get the point.
Make her come out. And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful. She can't get out of this house. She can't even think she can get out of this house. We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes. And I don't want Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger. That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven. So we're gonna seal the place up. They wanna hole up in here? Fine, we'll help 'em. Make it impossible for them to leave. Once they come out of that room.
Who else but God could think this shit up? I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in. God, man, He just loves the irony.
God.
She didn't.
Peace out.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Not with me. Not with people.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Adios.
Yeah, whatever.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
What about us?
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Hey.
Shit!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
They're gonna die in there!
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
I did.
Can't. Whole point. Can't get in the room.
She lied. Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em. Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna do?
Shut up and let me think.
Shut up.
I am. I'm an idiot's son. An idiot's grandson. I'm third- generation idiot. But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy. You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early? I can't believe my eyes. Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham. You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green. Come on, Buddy. One more hand.
Not if we keep 'em here. You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace. Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
It's still a good plan. It's just... got a twist.
Different tables.
I met him at the tables, same as you. And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him? Hey, who's the idiot? Huh?
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
They won't get hurt.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. We're okay, here. We can do this, right?
This is insane. I'm outta here.
Who is this guy?
I mean, right? Isn't it?
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
This was your department, Junior.
Keep your voice down.
I know.
+++$+++ The sentence that started "There are three." What was the rest?
+++$+++ May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
+++$+++ Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
+++$+++ You don't look so good.
+++$+++ Can we come in?
+++$+++ We'd like to come in.
+++$+++ Can we come in?
I don't get it.
Huh?
Yeah?
That door is a safely hazard.
Hey, this is perfect for you... Absolutely! You're a woman, you're living alone now. Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night. What are you going to do? Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday? Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out? I think not!
Oh, I've seen these...
Could the child please stop that?
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
The hotel guy? It's been in the papers lately. His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it. Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
No ball, kid.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
Don't!
I said open the door.
Open it.
A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep, in medieval times.
Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Observe.
Suit yourself.
We're leaving.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem. And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
Cut it back a little bit.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. We can still handle this. Can we still handle this?
Watch your mouth.
Open the door.
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
No, Edgar Allen.
Ever read any Poe?
Makes me nervous.
What?
This is it? I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks. Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
How many more do we have after this?
Could you slow down a little? Or we could wait for the car...
Okay.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Where is the Glucogen?
What if I spazz out?
Not an option.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign. Did you see any sugar in here? Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay? Can you hear me?
What?
Why?
I'm sorry.
He --
Stop it.
He won't even know who it was.
Uh uh.
On it!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
What are you doing?
No.
Not in the bedroom. Do it!
Do it.
We're never getting out of here.
Got him!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Morse code?
What, what, what is it?!
YOU HAVE TO!
YOU CAN'T DO THAT! YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT! YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
I don't know, why?
What am I, a five year old?
Don't though.
Little bit. Yeah.
Give me a break.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Fuck.
We're not coming out. We're not letting you in. Get out of my house.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Huh uh.
Nope.
Yeah.
I heard you.
What if they get in here?
What do we do?
What do they want?
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Damn it!
What?!
He's going down.
What's going on?!
Don't.
0150.
The crowd goes wild.
478-0150.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Too many stairs.
No...
Alma I told you to...
Those ain't cops.
I'm okay... listen to me... Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Tyrone...
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
+++$+++ For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
+++$+++ Well... is it loaded?
+++$+++ Lemme see that rifle son...
+++$+++ What are you doing with the gun?
+++$+++ Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
You know it brother.
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras. Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is? Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost. We all lost.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Yeah, it's me.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand? I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Get out of the fucking car.
Get out of the car.
Yeah... whatever you say.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
I got you.
Yeah.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
You know it. Stay Black...
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
You know that's bullshit.
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Look this is bull...
No Fuck you!!!
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Naw... I gotta...
Cy... I ain't even sure.
You joining? My Brother.. My brother.
You got it. Berkeley?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Party needs the bread. Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Inside ain't in the system. It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
I don't think that will be any problem...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Rodgers... this is no good...
Jesus...
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Now hold on Rodgers...
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
You want me to put a man on it?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Huh, well then... did someone else start shooting?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
So talk...
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this. Brother we got momentum!
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
We're like policing the police.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Wait a second there brother...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
What's the pig's name?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
What, I don't know how you mean?
I don't know about that.
They were empty...
Right on Brother Judge...
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
So what's the deal?
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
You were. infantry right?
We'll all get out of here together.
Motherfuckers...
You alright?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Bullshit...
What are you saying?
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge?
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Nothing.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Huh?
Busted firing pin. You want only the legal stuff right?
Maybe...
What you see is what you got. That's' Bobby Seale.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Yeah, I do.
I saw... but...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Ain't no one seen him.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
This cool the heat off you any?
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
My Mom's at that.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
You believe that?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I saw. I saw that big one hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too. They take you to jail?
You don't look alright.
Thank you.
Late summer.
Good.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You call that a compliment?
Uh... uh... I...
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
The hell I do.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Well?
Am I one of that sort?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
It worked. How many men can you raise?
I expect to try.
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
You got salt last week.
I know him well enough?
You don't know him very well, do you?
He shouldn't make light. That Redcoat should not have been killed.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Of course, I do.
I know that.
Excuse me?
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
You couldn't have known.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
As do you.
Thank you.
With a lace table cloth?
Who cared for your wounds?
What unit?
You're surrendering.
Their names, ranks and posts?
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.
Prisoner exchange.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. And my men are excellent marksmen.
I consider them linked.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
That one is a bit more difficult.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Very well, proceed, sir.
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Shall we proceed?
Colonel will do.
Apology accepted.
My pleasure, sir.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
I understand, sir.
Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Probably.
Perhaps.
Most certainly. Arrange it.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
My harrier. Join us, Colonel.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well. Stay the course.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort. It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two. We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee. The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight. That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
We buried them, then we went to track. It was a cold trail and they were moving fast. We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect.
That's not enough. Tell me.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
No, I don't.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
Is it her? Is Anne in there?
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it. A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Granted. Where are you going?
Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Gabriel? Are you asleep?
Father?
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
I didn't see any.
Less than a mile. Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
You know how old I am.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Yes... ... father.
Yes, sir.
He tried. It didn't take.
Yes, sir. My father taught me.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
What now, sir?
Father...
You're in no condition to ride.
Not yet. What happened?
Yes.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money.
The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent. He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Father, a post rider came from Charleston. You have a letter inside.
You don't hate him.
There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you.
He left us.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign. We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists. It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Your son, what did you name him?
Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Goodbye, Harry.
No. It's not over yet. Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton. It will end, one way or another. Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
They're gone. And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
How many men have we seen die?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry... ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Not held, just slowed down.
Not me, you. I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
The bigger problem is where, not when. The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield. Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive. A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga. The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
We're a breath away from losing this war. In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats. Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back. He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
I am, I think.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle. He spent too many years in the British army.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.
Gabriel.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
That's what I'm doing. I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
You said bribery twice...
That's five, keep going...
Name five hundred.
Balderdash!
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
That's a damn long time...
A long time ago...
Damn it, Francis! How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
It's Mister Marion.
+++$+++ Yes... you will wait.
+++$+++ Yes, quite, but you should know that...
+++$+++ You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
+++$+++ Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
But what about Thomas?
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads. We're safer here.
Don't worry.
How far away?
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
+++$+++ About a hundred and twenty. Less than a third.
+++$+++ For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Don't depend on my decency. I'm one of that sort.
For what?
+++$+++ I heard about your son. I'm sorry.
And what is the second thing?
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait. He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Worse.
Remember Braddock?
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters. I lose the sons of other men.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Gray.
But father, they might come this way.
God willing.
Seventeen.
Not yet, Thomas.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Quiet.
Six-pounders. Lots of them.
Thank you. Did you finish the upper field?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Is that right, dad?
Yes--
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well...I guess not.
Ayuh.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Of course I will.
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Honey, Church will be fine.
Yes, but the rope might be--
It's gorgeous!
Do you swear?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
I'm sure you're not.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
But don't you dare say that.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
What's up, sugar?
Huh?
Ellie? What's wrong?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
Because you promised.
Is he really all right?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
To remember.
For a little while.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Yayyy!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Yaay!
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Was it Pascow?
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
And because the dead walked.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Shit! Look at this mess!
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Rachel not feeling well?
What?
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Wendigo?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
Wouldn't wash?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
But--
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Doesn't look like they last long.
What are those for?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
I guess so...but...
Why? For God's sake, why?
Whose burying ground?
This time I mean it.
Almost there, Louis.
It's funny, all right.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Is there quicksand?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
I'm not climbing that.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
What do you mean?
Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Then come on.
Does she love the cat?
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Going to tell Ellie?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle. Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there... the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure. Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Sure.
What's at the end of it?
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Nice.
What?
What were you listening to?
God, that's fine.
Not at all.
Well, maybe I----
Hey--they actually found the place!
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
You don't understand--
Remember.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
I'm sure.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
You better get going, hon.
I'm going to try to do better.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Good d--
Getting there.
Thank you, Louis.
Well, honey...you know that...
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I just said--
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
She's finally asleep.
I think it's rather extraordinary.
My God!
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Jesus, the road!
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
How does he do that?
You'll get it back. Or one better.
Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together --
He didn't waste it.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. I agreed to set them free. I didn't when ... nor where.
Eh? You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Elizabeth goes free!
You can't. I can.
She. Goes. Free.
Or you could surrender.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye, for us there is.
Men! Are you up for it?
Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas. But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
The situation has changed.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Why don't I want to do this?
No, I really think I do.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.
I'll watch my back.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Track you down and --
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.
I'll torture it out of you.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No. But him I believe. He us genuinely angry.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Now?
Agreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
The curse drove you to gather this?
It's a pirate medallion.
Would that I could.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
You've got sand, for a maid.
You have a name, missy?
Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
I'll drop it!
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means 'No.'
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. What is it you want?
My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
That would hardly be proper.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
What?
Not as a condition -- a request.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind. This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career. But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved. The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Man overboard!
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think? He fancies you, you know.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
-- then we never would have met.
To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Exactly.
Nor did you, I noticed.
Exactly.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
Why?
What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
To freedom.
Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
That was before I met one, of course.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.
What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
But ... you did it before! Last time --
What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Come on!
You're in league with Barbossa!
You?!
You are despicable.
Miss Swann.
How did you get off the island?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
First -- have you found me a crew?
Aye, that'll about do it.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot. Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
We're not going to just surrender!
How did he get off the island?
Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share. So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the bearings. That night, there was a mutiny.
I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
I know. That was for the smell.
I don't think that will be necessary.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Raise the sails.
Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
I said, no lies.
Smith.
That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Sorry, I didn't know.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You would do that?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
We had time to get to know each other.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship. You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of. You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?
Jack!
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy.
No.
Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you! It's going badly!
On what?
What's that?
But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate--
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Just do it quickly.
Tortuga?
You didn't beat me. You ignored the rule of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
It's not true my father was a pirate.
That's not true.
'Bootstrap?'
My father. William Turner?
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy. After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Aye! Avast!
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start. My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Come aboard.
I'd die for her.
Why are brothering with that?
Not without my effects.
Agreed.
How? The key's run off.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Why ask me?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Somewhat.
No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
No.
Pirate.
You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
Who makes all these?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ...
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
He's not telling the truth.
And no lies!
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying?
No.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
You haven't seen it.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen it?
No, it's not.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Please.
A moment.
Bleak. Very bleak.
No. She hasn't.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Where did he come from?
My apologies, Governor.
No. The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here. You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Speak.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Until he's done.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal. He'll sleep, that's all.
Do? Well, I suppose that depends on you.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in. I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay. I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust. I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven. Science is the quest for divine perfection.
Pollution?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched. Poppy?
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
You can't mean that.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way to stop it.
No.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien. The nanobot has changed that.
Wheelchair accessible.
You can't do this! You owe me, O'Brien. I made you plastic! I made you!
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me! I'll give you anything you want!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Oh no. You're not like me. In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
Ain't it.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
Wow, that is one moving story. Take it easy on my heart strings. Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities. I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Not that.
Did you feel that?
If you loved me like I loved you?
What I asked you earlier?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
It will be an ascension.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Consideration?
Icarus?
Then you still love me?
Look at me, Icarus! Look at my body. I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to. 'We will always love most that which we create.' Is that still true?
Why are there two ottomans?
No, Icky, this is real.
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
That remains to be seen.
Eventually. These things are always a matter of leverage.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives. The instant, understand?
You're right. Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Nebbleman.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab. I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
You don't either. We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up. I need you focused and in control.
Who cares! We've got to find him! Hurry!
Don't be a child, Icarus. She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
She did not. The mouse ran down the drain.
She says it's not.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus. It will be ready soon.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
You're not rotting meat.
Donated to science. Perfect.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears. The gardener will know what to do.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman. You have outdone yourself.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
They're here! They're here! We have the nanobot.
Where did he go?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
That might work.
Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Cleaned up? It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized! That's what we've been trying to tell you! The only thing we can do is run! Run! Run!
The nanobot is gone.
I want Trix! Mommy!
I like Trix!
Yeah, I do!
Hey!
What are you going to do? Make me throw it out?
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this. If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass! Haw-haw!
Haw-haw! Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Yeah? So what?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
I'm a scientist. I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
You're afraid of him.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Is that what Argon told you?
Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel. He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How can that not affect you?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't. The situation is critical right now. The replicators are growing exponentially. If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
You're looking for a urine sample.
What I've always done. As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
I hope you're right. I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
The replicators?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
That's the guy?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right? I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
What did he want?
A man?
Aaabout...?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright. You're just in time.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
So, I guess it worked.
Yes. That's it. He's got it. Oh God, he's got it!
Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Okay.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
It's Sim. We're almost there.
I guess they do.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time? I think that happens a lot. People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
God, what a fight that was.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal. Do you remember that?
I have to!
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
The same thing I suppose.
Yes.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
We've got to get the nanobot.
What in the...?
Susie... I...
You saved my life.
Run, Daniel! Get out of here!
Argon's private lab.
Oh no! Argon! We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot! We have to get the nanobot!
I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
I don't believe it. You're here! Oh thank God.
I can't go back to jail. I gotta get out of here.
The head shrinker at the prison.
On the counter.
Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Like a glove.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Getting used to it.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
I think it would be better for me to go alone. I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza.
Something else I want to try.
I'm going to go out for a while. I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
How far can you stretch?
The nanobot... it's not here...
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
No problem.
Probably the caffeine.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Yeah. Old times.
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
Blame the victim.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Means? Oh no. We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
Oh yeah, real funny. Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
Just look at it!
Look at this!
Susan!
Is something wrong?
Lungs sound fine. You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you? Allergies? Infections?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
That's right.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Three days ago it was.
What happens?
The waste.
Got it.
That was 'simple'?
What waste?
Why do we need it?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Why?
What are these?
We don't?
I'm a plastic man! A plastic man!
Oh God, please! This can't be happening! I can't be plastic! A plastic man?!
Oh no, no, no! You've got to be able to fix me! Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Yes.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
I don't know.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
... just like the mouse.
They did it to me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Am I? Look! Right there! That's exactly what I am talking about.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency. All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up! If you're gonna flip your wig --
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We'll see? What does that mean?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think. It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole. It's really wonderful.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Right. You predicted it.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell. I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly. Exciting stuff. I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals.
The big house?
Is that so?
Same old Daniel.
You know, this and that.
Been out for six months now.
What? No kiss? Not even for old times sake?
The question is, are you?
Oh yeah?
An ass-beating. Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all. Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
I get it. You're the goon fetch boy. The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
What? I'm not going anywhere!
You! I remember you!
And you have him?
Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He's alive?
It's a miracle.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!
You won't. That's why you're whispering.
Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities. I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Vermin...
What in the hell?
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Yes - Sing Sing.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Stew—
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Yes - isn't it.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him. —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them! Come on, Gallagher.
Fine! I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane— —goes out and counts the silverware.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
Your house?
Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Anne, come here. Listen—
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
What are you talking about?
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Yes - isn't it?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Gallagher!
Oh yes you will wear garters—
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I know that.
You wear them of course, silly.
Do you like them?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough? What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Now let's get this settled—
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve. The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is? It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up. He's all right. I like him.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
How-di-do.
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Oh, Mother!
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me. Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
You don't wear garters!
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Really?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and —
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
For what?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
So, it's obvious, huh?
No - give you another guess.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
You may go, Smythe.
You're all right.
May I use your telephone?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Don't mind Mother.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names? I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Mother!
+++$+++ It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
+++$+++ Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
+++$+++ I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot. What does it say about the reception last night?
+++$+++ Sit down!
+++$+++ It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
+++$+++ What is this person doing here?
+++$+++ That's an excellent idea.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know—
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Thank you very much.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh yeah?
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Yeah!
Is that so?
We were classmates.
Yale '21, I believe.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
This way.
Fine. Have a seat.
You're the Tribune man?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see. Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I bring a message from Garcia.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet? "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
I'm afraid.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—' Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
No?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey— Let me know when you're quitting.
Sure.
Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
My play.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
A what?
That's so.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Baloney! Joe! Bring me a special!
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Why not?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it! Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work. Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Not on my own beat, no.
It has been alleged - yes—
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Come on, get going, get going!
Right - for the first time this year.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yes sir!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
That's a canary, sir.
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
Quite so. Quite.
But not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
You're my what?
Who are you?
How do you like your bath, sir?
I bet.
Yes.
Thank you. Where is Mr. Smith?
+++$+++ Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—
+++$+++ Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
+++$+++ I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
There's nothing sudden about that— He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Hey, Gallagher!
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Here you are.
What could I be?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Then why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
What do you know about Conrad?
Did who?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Been where?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Yes - and I'd love it.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Nothing.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
There you are—!
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
My error.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Not since you broke into society.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
It's the smoke.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I didn't run away.
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens! And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
—and those and them.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
You what?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
The boss is getting hoarse.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Yes.
We just thought that—
I beg your pardon.
That's putting it crudely, but—
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
I don't eat waffles.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Now don't be absurd, Smith— May I come in?
I suppose you know why I came—?
Hello, Smith.
Traps shut!
Well, at best you might deny it.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
I think you'd better go.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I have it here.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What's Michael tearing the paper about?
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Hello, Joe.
It's all right. Bring him in.
Sure.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
I have. Double-strength!
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Double-strength!
+++$+++ Some bicarbonate - quick!
+++$+++ Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
+++$+++ What is it, Smythe?
+++$+++ Heavens! The man's insane!
+++$+++ What's going on here? Who is this woman?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
+++$+++ And you struck him right here in our house—?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Yes - the worm!
Good morning, everybody— Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh? Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
All right, Grandma—
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Nobody seems to want to do anything— Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
With pleasure, Madame!
+++$+++ Why—
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Very good, sir.
That's all I wanted to know!
A bird in a gilded cage?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
I just putter.
Well, sir, I putter.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir!
Yeah.
You try it.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Did you call, sir?
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Well done, sir. Very neat.
But I—
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
The name is Smythe.
I understand, sir.
Well ... ... Your father would never do anything like that.
Yes ... It's just that ...
Yes.
Ah.
No. I want to know.
What?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Can I ask you a question?
Mary Sue?
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Thanks.
I love you too.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Sure.
What?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Looks just like it did.
In my handbag.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
I'm fine.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Like a drum.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
But I really should get home.
+++$+++ I don't know.
No ...
+++$+++ It's alright.
+++$+++ Wait ...
+++$+++ No she's not.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Bud?
Where'd you get this?
I think it looks nice.
+++$+++ Thanks.
+++$+++ No, no ... Come on in.
+++$+++ Oh, hi ...
+++$+++ Oh, hello Betty.
Where are you gonna go?
No I'm not sweetie.
I don't want it to go away.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
Sure you are.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you where I was.
Oh, George ...
Oh darling that's wonderful! I always knew you could do it.
How was your day?
It's better, Mary Sue.
With what?
Why not?
We were gonna ... You know ...
It's six-thirty ...
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
It is?
I think ... I might be ill ...
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Lover's Lane!
But where would we go?
What?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Um ... It's ...
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
She won't go out with me?
Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
I don't believe it.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
But it could happen.
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
+++$+++ Okay, that's IT!!!
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Real rain?
Are you alright? What is it?
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
I really don't know. Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
One of those ... big beds?
No. What?
"Changes."
I'm fine--but thank you.
Oh, no thanks ...
No it isn't.
It's not in ME.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
You're not allowed to lie.
Okay--that's enough!
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
It's like the basketball team.
I think I've got something to say.
It was accessible to everyone.
Well--it was dark out ...
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Do you know that it's illegal?
Did you do this?
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
What do you mean!?
Dan! Arrest them!
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
How'd you know about the fire?
+++$+++ The other one?
+++$+++ Green.
+++$+++ Yes.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Right here.
Honestly ... no.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
I told you. I'm like positive.
What?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Can I ask you a question?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
No. She really liked you.
Yeah ...
Sure.
So what is it?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
You're reading?
Nothing.
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Not directly anyhow ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Me too. Sounds swell.
They don't have that kind of potential.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you?
Well if I don't who will?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you? You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Nothing.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Jen please ...
They don't notice that kind of thing.
He won't notice anyway.
It's in your closet.
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
Jen, listen ...
JENNIFER!
What were you doing in a library?
What?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I don't think so.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Hunh.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Who's that?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Play along?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
You know him?
We're supposed to be in school.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
I don't believe this.
What's going to happen?
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
What did you do?
What happened?
YOU get lost!
God, David. Just give it to me!
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Lemme see that.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Pleasantville Marathon?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
What are you doing?
I like calling you David.
You're gonna forget about me.
Where are they?
Can I open it?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
What do we do?
Real rain?
What's going on?
They just grow like that?
Hunh?
Mmmm. Boy. It's hot up here.
What's that like?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Out there.
So what's it like?
Yeah ... I guess. I don't know.
Mmmmgh.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Oh ... Hi.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
No. I baked them for you.
No. I baked them for you.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
That was sure swell ...
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Scout?
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
DYKE +++$+++ Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous. Sleep well.
DYKE +++$+++ This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
DYKE +++$+++ Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
They weren't my memories. I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Why?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
DYKE +++$+++ You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
DYKE +++$+++ OW!
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
No you're not.
Why?
DYKE +++$+++ Oh no? Let me show you something!
DYKE +++$+++ OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
DYKE +++$+++ It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
DYKE +++$+++ Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
DYKE +++$+++ A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ... You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
DYKE +++$+++ What do I MEAN! You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
DYKE +++$+++ NOW!
DYKE +++$+++ I want a word with you ...
DYKE +++$+++ BUD.
DYKE +++$+++ Excuse me?
DYKE +++$+++ Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
DYKE +++$+++ I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
DYKE +++$+++ Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
DYKE +++$+++ What?
DYKE +++$+++ So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
... Hi.
COME BACK!!!
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Where are you going ...
Don't get upset.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
DYKE +++$+++ Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
DYKE +++$+++ Why would I do that?
What the hell's going on!
DYKE +++$+++ Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
DYKE +++$+++ Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
DYKE +++$+++ Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
No. McIntire's. Remember: "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
McIntire's.
Yeah ...
... Like Prince Charming.
... Her father.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
DYKE +++$+++ We'll get you fixed up in no time.
DYKE +++$+++ Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
It's beautiful.
+++$+++ Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
What's wrong?
+++$+++ Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
I brought you something ... From the library.
Hi.
+++$+++ Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
+++$+++ Really?
+++$+++ Well don't you?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
... What's that?
So they can have their hamburgers!
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Forget about that!
Just listen to me ...
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
+++$+++ Oh--what's the point, Bud?
+++$+++ There aren't any cheeseburgers.
+++$+++ Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
+++$+++ You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
+++$+++ Bud ...
+++$+++ Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Do you have the lettuce?
+++$+++ Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
+++$+++ There aren't any cheeseburgers.
+++$+++ I'm so glad you're here.
+++$+++ But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
+++$+++ Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
+++$+++ Oh.
+++$+++ Bud?
Oh GOD ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
DYKE +++$+++ A miracle.
DYKE +++$+++ Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Free?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
DYKE +++$+++ What's the rush?
DYKE +++$+++ Well here I am.
DYKE +++$+++ Yeah. TV busted?
DYKE +++$+++ TV repair.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Hey.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
So you can't talk to me?
Yeah but what are you doing?
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
D&D Mattress Man.
Somewhere in Utah.
Ok. Thank you.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
That's it.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
This is "Fly With Us?"
And what was this?
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
I just want to know where she's staying.
I....please don't do this.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Call me later.
I have no idea.
It's not mine.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Are you gonna do it?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
It's not cool?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Why?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
You look nervous.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
You just said very food.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
I know.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
...please, I just don't want it....
Please don't.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Hello.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello?
+++$+++ ...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
I have to go.
This is not cool.
+++$+++ No you won't.
+++$+++ Why did you tell me you did, then?
+++$+++ You lied to me?
+++$+++ -- you said you did.
+++$+++ Should I just ask your girlfriend? Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Hello?
....what....?
No. I'm sorry.
+++$+++ I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
+++$+++ Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
+++$+++ Really? Please?
+++$+++ Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
+++$+++ You don't even know how much it is.
+++$+++ Yeah.
+++$+++ This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh.... I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
+++$+++ Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ? Do you remember?
+++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
+++$+++ You're going to work now?
+++$+++ Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
+++$+++ I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
+++$+++ It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
+++$+++ Georgia.
+++$+++ Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
No.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah.....
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
...yes...
No.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
No.
...just talking to you....
....no....
Sure.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Where are you?
No.
Nothing.
Hi. This is Jack.
Yes.
Hello, this is Back.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
You can't do that.
You left me at the hospital.
Let's go to the hospital.
Yes I'm sorry.
Are you ok?
It's ok to ask that.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
For what?
This is nice.
This is funny.
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
Yeah.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah......yeah.....
Ok. Where are you from originally?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Where you married?
I just wanted to make sure.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Yeah?
Hello?
Have a good trip.
I don't freak out.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
I don't freak out very often.
I'll see you later.
That was good.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
This is Lena.
Ok. Have a good trip.
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Yeah.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Yes? I'm trying.
...yes I did...?
What?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
There's a better place for us to eat.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
What did he want?
What happened?
Is everything ok?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
No I didn't say that.
....No....
....yeah....
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
You see?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
That's nice. It's nice. I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You like her?
How long have you known her?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. You're friends with my sister?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
Who is it?
....Hi.....
Ok.
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Ok.
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Oh My God.
What do you do with all this pudding?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
I saw a picture of you.
Business is good, you're busy?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Hi.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
There's a piano in the street.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Not very well.
I don't know.
I don't know.
They don't get opened until eight.
No.
Bye.
Ok.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Did you have my home phone number?
It's a plastic, yeah.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
The police are on their way.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Your hand is bleeding.
I didn't do that.
On my knife.
I cut myself.
I don't know.
No.
No.
Yeah.
Why?
+++$+++ It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
+++$+++ That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
+++$+++ You want her to call you Jack?
+++$+++ No one will know your name.
+++$+++ It's ok, take your time.
+++$+++ Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
+++$+++ It's just for verification through the credit card company.
+++$+++ And your Social Security number.
+++$+++ And your name?
+++$+++ And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
+++$+++ Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
+++$+++ What do you mean?
+++$+++ -- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
+++$+++ Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
+++$+++ Hi, is this your first time calling?
+++$+++ Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
That's that.
Yes I did.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
What?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
....I have seven.
.....Well yes I do.... But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
Sorry about that.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Like a psychiatrist?
I don't like the way I am sometimes. Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
And I'm sorry that I did that.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
Yeah.
How's business?
How you doin' Barry?
Fine, thank you.
Can you hang on a second?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
+++$+++ It takes time to process --
+++$+++ I'm sorry.
+++$+++ It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Let's just figure that out later -- Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
....now: this pudding?
Yeah.
Ok.
Ok.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Where you goin?
....I made a call..... ....and, uh....
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
...I'll tell you later.
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
So what should I do with the pudding?
You should go on a trip.
You're goin' on a trip?
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
Good morning, Barry....
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
....yes.....
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Yes I'm fine.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Alright, alright.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
What?
Hi.
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Yes. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
I won't.
I'll see you there.
Ok.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Ok.
I know.
I won't.
Seven o'clock.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Nothing.
Yes I am.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
This is Barry.
That's it.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
I thought Latisha said you would --
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
When can you leave?
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Put him through.
What did you say?
Hello?
What's the problem?
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
So they'll go.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
So...did my brother call you?
Just tell him to call me.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Are you coming to eat with us?
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
We should be going --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
It's not bad, it's ok.
Yeah.
I'll go pay for my car.
It's ok. That's alright.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
MAUPAS +++$+++ My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
MAUPAS +++$+++ I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Then what's he doing here?
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
+++$+++ Now give the signal.
+++$+++ Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
+++$+++ For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
What? What've I done?
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
By whom? The Marquis?
"Turn you out?"
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
In part, yes.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Not now, or we're both done for.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
Madeleine --
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Mustn't do that, sir.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
Of course.
I'm here.
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Then it must've been love --
Was it impotence?
Why was it you never took her by force?
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
AND DID YOU?
I know, because I felt it myself --
-- the passion in your heart --
I saw the longing in your eye --
It's no secret that you loved her.
An innocent child is dead.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Your wig. Remove your wig.
NOW STRIP.
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
What on earth would that require?
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Valcour. His chair.
+++$+++ And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
+++$+++ My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
Good day, Marquis.
That's enough.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
You always do.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
+++$+++ You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
+++$+++ We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
+++$+++ He can't do that to me.
You mean to take us all down with you?
If you only mean to dupe me again --
+++$+++ You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
+++$+++ Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
+++$+++ Mightier than the sword indeed.
+++$+++ They can't be serious.
+++$+++ It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
+++$+++ I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
+++$+++ It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
+++$+++ I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
+++$+++ There I was taxed; it's true.
+++$+++ And --?
+++$+++ Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
+++$+++ But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
+++$+++ Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
+++$+++ Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
+++$+++ Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
I've stared into the face of evil... ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
How is the patient faring?
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
You'd suffer in her stead?
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
What could cause a tincture like this?
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
It was fiction, of course.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
I have.
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
And --?
Well?
And place my reputation at stake?
You find this amusing, do you?
You're a sentimental man.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Oh. That.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
And he's never once attempted escape?
His wife's?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
Of course.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Yes?
But I am history.
As for the author... shoot him.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets. "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher mission.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I'll be waiting.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Here it is; the last chapter.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
+++$+++ Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
"Well worth the dig!"
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
+++$+++ "What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
+++$+++ Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
+++$+++ Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
+++$+++ -- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
+++$+++ Go on, child.
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
+++$+++ Surely you've seen a man naked.
They've taken your clothes?
+++$+++ My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
What have they done to you now?
+++$+++ The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
+++$+++ The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
+++$+++ Fiendishly so.
+++$+++ Most assuredly.
+++$+++ The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
There's something else I want from you.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
+++$+++ Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
+++$+++ I'm hungry for a proper visit.
+++$+++ You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
+++$+++ "By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
+++$+++ "...your wife."
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
+++$+++ Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
This is neither the time nor the place --
Good God, Marquise --
Of course.
And I in yours.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
+++$+++ It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
+++$+++ Oh, but I am!
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
+++$+++ I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
+++$+++ Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I pray you: be succinct.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
+++$+++ He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
+++$+++ Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
+++$+++ Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
+++$+++ They've put you up to this, haven't they?
+++$+++ You've come to lecture me?
+++$+++ How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
+++$+++ Forgive me, I beg you --
+++$+++ ....shame on you, truly...
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Doesn't that please you?
But it's just begun --
+++$+++ She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
+++$+++ Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
+++$+++ We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
+++$+++ Of being found out. Of not being a genius
+++$+++ You're just scared.
+++$+++ It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
+++$+++ So you ever gonna do a picture?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
But I am That's the killer, honey.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
+++$+++ Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
+++$+++ Sure
+++$+++ And he did.
He needs me here.
I can't
+++$+++ Mm.
+++$+++ Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
+++$+++ Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
+++$+++ You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
+++$+++ Houdini mice.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
The actor
Who are you, sir?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Why is that, Louis?
You know that can't happen.
Yeah
Uh-hub.
Over at RKO?
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Louis
I don't want you to--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I will not have this in my home.
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't t-t-t-tolerate it.
You are repellant when you drink.
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Not for me.
I wanted it
You needn't use that language with me
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
Then you explain it to me?!
This picture--
Marion--
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
It's not really--
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
Don't
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w... will.
There. That's right.
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
There's no call for that language-
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
He lied to me
Sir, I-
Sir?
Sir?
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
The drinking.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
+++$+++ love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
+++$+++ I can't remember the lines!
+++$+++ "You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--" Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
I am not doing Hearst.
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
We're using-
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Can I talk to Hearst?
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Uh-huh
That's right
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
I wanna see the picture today
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
What have I done?
Shit
Mank!
You gonna watch?
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
It's too late. The movie's made
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
What does this have to do with--?
Christ.
So they're Jews. . .
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
No, you gotta hear this-
Hey, kid. Gregg.
I don't give a shit about-
I don't care.
Fuck you. You wanted me out. I'm out.
I just can't . . see it anymore
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Jesus Christ --
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
Craig is one syllable
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
The title?
What?
It's good, huh?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
And what does he see?
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
Why her?
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
How?
So, who is he? We have to know him.
He'll destroy us.
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ... great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Listen to me-
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Sorry to disappoint.
Fuck you
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Mank-
Yes.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Jesus
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
The old man has his own way of doing things
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth. Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
The great Spanish bullfighter
Manolete?!
Sigmund Freud?
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
But with compassion and insight--
We find the man and then we dissect him-
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Not for me.
Magic
Showing life
Telling stories.
Forget it-
Nonsense
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Oh God.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j- that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Thank you-
Yes.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Get out.
Get out
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
You talked to New York?
You're lying to me.
You're going to destroy it
To do what?
Very generous
It came.
+++$+++ "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
+++$+++ "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
+++$+++ "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
+++$+++ "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
+++$+++ "Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
It was fun, wasn't it?
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
Happy birthday.
I don't want to sit
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
No, we're jake. But listen-
It was a -joke, George
I really think you're
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
It's just that my movie is so-
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
Then find another theater
The ad..
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
They've all seen a rough cut
Ah, it's a grand title.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Pardon?
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
He's Christ?
Oh, no--
We done?
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
For what?
About what?
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Ok, champ.
Just come by to wish you luck. Need anything?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Hey champ!
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
How can he embarrass you?
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
What?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
None of your fuckin' business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Where you going at this hour?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
This looks done.
Where's your wife, Jake?
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Whatsa matter with you?
Whadda ya mean?
What?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
So what?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
What?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
I did keep an eye...
What?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
No, I just told you what happened.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
When?
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Well, that's what I mean.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Where you been?
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Except fall down like a normal person.
See? That's all there was to it.
C'mon, Joey.
Yeah, I know.
What did Tommy say?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What do you mean?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Nah, she would never...
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Say what you're gonna say.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
You want us to wait for you?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Do you see her yet?
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
With her? How?
Huh?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Whadda you care?
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Answer me when I talk to you.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Jack! Enough!
Here's your glove.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Hit me in the face.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
What's wrong?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
You sound bitter.
Does that mean...
I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
At night?
What time is it?
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
What friends?
Don't make no difference no more.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
All right, just don't make any noise.
The kids are sleeping.
Are you drunk?
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
I dunno.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Then what?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
OK. Talk.
What?
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Yeah --
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal. You're rotten. Rotten. Rotten. You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me. Kill me. I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
You did?
You're a fuckin' liar.
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt! Who've you been fuckin'?
With Salvy, eh?
Do I have to kill you, eh? Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer? I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What was it about?
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
I called. You weren't there.
Where you been all day?
I went out.
What's the matter with you?
Don't ever do that again. You don't do it!
You're hurting my arm.
All I did...
What did I do?
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
That he's got a pretty face.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Huh?
You asleep?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
No, I'm not.
I'm not interested in him.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Oh, Jake.
Now take your panties off.
Go 'head. Do it.
Now take the rest off.
Jake...
Come here.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Come over here.
It's OK.
That's all right. He don't mind.
What does that mean?
Can you see it?
I can't find my ball.
Should I hit it?
It feels real good.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
How's the weight? Ok?
He should.
Never felt better.
C'mon, Tommy --
Jake, sit down for a minute.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Excuse me for living.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Right, the gym.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Get lost. Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
+++$+++ Goodnight.
+++$+++ Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
+++$+++ I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
+++$+++ This is the baby sitter.
+++$+++ This is Doyle's house.
But his leg!
Jefferies?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
That's what they call a family problem.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Namely?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Where'd they take Lisa?
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Like an old hambone?
A possibility.
Like what?
I told you that --
Your Lisa?
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
This is Doyle, Jeff.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Oh -- that phone call! I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
But I'm not a killer!
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
You figured that out, huh?
You sure it belongs to his wife?
Jewelry?
You think he's getting out of here?
Mrs. Thorwald.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
A detective's nightmare.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --" He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
I can't do it even if he's gone.
I can't do that.
If possible -- both.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Jeff -- huh?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Who left -- where?
Not yet.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Six ayem.
-- until yesterday morning.
She never left the apartment --
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it. Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
By the way what happened to your leg?
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
You told me. I've got to run, Jeff.
His wife took a trip.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there -- -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
It's me.
Gunnison?
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Where?
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Wrong day?
This is Wednesday.
For getting rid of that cast.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Tell her to bring it back!
Can you get me that ring back?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
I don't know what you mean.
Why should I?
Who are you?
Did you get my note?
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Ten here.
How much do you think you'll need?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
There's probably one in the basement.
Got a shovel?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Would four of them -- ?
You can tell that from here?
What?
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Look!
There's something buried there.
And digging in. Look at that flower bed.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. An old, ornery friend.
Huh?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
A Federal offense.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Isn't he a salesman?
He and his wife splitting up?
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Keep your mind off her.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
People have different emotional levels that --
We've progressed emotionally in --
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
That's the hard part.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
You're never going to marry?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
She's only perfect.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause. What is it? You have a fight?
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
That's abnormal.
That's normal.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Gives your circulation something to fight. What kind of trouble?
I knew it!
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
I predicted it.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
+++$+++ Goodnight, you idiot.
+++$+++ Who's Thorwald?
+++$+++ I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
+++$+++ It is something really important, Jeff?
You haven't even heard from him?
Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
Mrs. Doyle?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
How?
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring! Do you ever leave yours at home?
Too close.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Well?
Is he cleaning house?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Do you like it?
I'll rephrase the question.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Huh?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
I hate funny exit lines.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
That's a suitcase?
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
We have all -- what?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
But only her husband would know that. And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Not yet!
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
I don't know.
I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
To get on home.
125 West Ninth Street.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
There's nothing to see.
She could be under sedatives, sleeping. He's in the room now.
Maybe she died.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
What is it you're looking for?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are -- -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
What do you think?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Homework. It's more interesting.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Tell me about it.
I have one now.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Without any future?
I mean what I said.
Not quite -- it seems. Goodbye, Jeff.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Of course not.
Lisa! Shut up!
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
I think it's enchanting.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours. You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
That's what I'm afraid of. Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
For yourself -- and me. I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
Yes.
Make the one you want.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Tired?
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Big enough?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Anything else bothering you?
And you love life?
And your stomach?
How's your leg?
Chelsea 2-5598.
L. B. Jefferies.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
What's happening?
Feel okay?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
I heard about it. You're lucky he lived.
I'm glad they let you out.
A new disease.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
We got to do something. Don't we?
I like you, you know?
This is the edge, boy. This is the end.
Sure. It's fine.
Hi.
Jim Stark.
Stay there.
Know the Millertown bluff?
How 'bout you? Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Somebody find him a knife.
Who's fighting? This is the test, man. It's a crazy game.
Chicken?
Meaning me?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
What?
Down in back.
Smashed the front door.
We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some kid earlier.
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
You still want to go home, Moose?
Hang loose. We got all night.
You clean out of your head? Come on!
No. We're going to bring him down.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
You see any cops?
Nothing, Crunch. They picked him up like the rest of--
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me. Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something Mom?
I don't want to learn that!
No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?
You don't want me to go.
Except yourself!
I don't think so--
Are you listening to me? You're involved in this! I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
That's not what I mean. I've never done anything right. I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it. I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
She never wants to hear. She doesn't care!
I was in it.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
I just want to show you how foolish you are. When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
You know I never stop you from anything. Believe me--you're at a wonderful age. In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Well, now--
We'll make time. Where's some paper. We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
How'd that happen! What kind of trouble you in?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Shoot, Jimbo.
I'm not hungry.
Yes.
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Yeah! Shh!
It's just this get-up. The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
You thought I was Mom?
Sure-- You know something? I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
Mother--
You buy me many things. Thank you.
You can't protect me.
Tell him why we moved here.
You sure?
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Have some cigars.
Sure. Sure.
What about you, Jim? Got anything to say for yourself?
Whoa! Whoa! I know you're a little upset but--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
You don't?
Stay here. That was my son!
No, honey. No, he's not here.
Open it.
I still think you should go down.
Look--just relax, will you?
He's home. I heard the car.
What's that pounding?
That's right!
Are you going to preach now? Are we going to have a sermon?
Did anyone see you there? I mean did they get your license number or anything?
Just relax, please relax!
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand? The kid has no friends yet and--
He's just loaded, honey.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
+++$+++ Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
+++$+++ They not together, sir. We don't see him in a long time now.
+++$+++ She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
+++$+++ Yes, sir.
Head-shrinker?
In my mother's drawer.
I don't know. End up in the electric chair?
No, sir. I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it. I guess I'm just no good?
Plato.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? Ever been booked before?
Come back tomorrow.
He's not here. He's not at Juvenile Hall. I don't know where he is. He's out on a call and he'll be out all night. How old are you?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Plato!
Those aren't my friends. Make them go away.
I shot at one of them.
Who's that?
They like you. Okay?
Friends never break promises, do they? Okay. Here. Now listen. There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe. You understand that? They said I could come in and bring you out.
You trust me, don't you? Just give it to me for a second.
In your pocket. Give it to me.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Can I keep it?
No.
You sure?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Here.
Why?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
That's swell. How are you?
I've got a gun.
I'm here.
Get away from me!
Your father!
Plato!
You remember that far back? Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Who?
When was that?
I had to go to a head-shrinker. I only went twice though. My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Not lately.
Hey! How 'bout that!
I'm what? What?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
We'll take it!
What?
Nobody talks to children! They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Isn't it crazy?
We're safe here. I hope. What do you think?
Shut up. Are you nuts?
I'm here. Shut up.
Help me in!
They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.
They're looking for you!--
It's me!
Jim!
O.K. G'night. I got to pick up my scooter. See you tomorrow.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to-- Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you? I don't have many--people I can talk to.
No. It's okay.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
How'd you get here?
What?
Are you really going to meet them?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
I'm here.
No. It's perpetual motion.
He has a knife.
You scared?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them. Now they're waiting for you.
Jim. What's yours?
I don't want to make friends.
What?
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Boy!
No. I don't think so--
Hi there.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom. Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. Dad?
No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
Just tell a little white lie?
But I am involved! We're all involved, Mom! A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Why should you be the only one.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Good Lord!
And you wanted him to make a list!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
How!
What happened, darling. We were so worried. I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
'Bye, Mom.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
I'm sorry.
Stop tearing me apart! You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
You serious?
Okay--
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Chicken?
"If he could" what? You mean your father?
Pretty mixed up?
What?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
But you don't think that's a solution.
So then you moved?
And your folks didn't understand?
Mess that kid up?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Try the desk.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
Go on--don't give me that. Someone giving you hard looks?
No.
Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to lock you up. Why?
Too bad you didn't connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Wash up and go home.
Get lost.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Plato!
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Cut it out now. I'm warning you.
Hey! That's enough static out of you.
Sure. He was trying to make us his family.
He needed you, maybe. So do I.
After he tried to shoot you?
We have to go back!
I love you, Jim. I really mean it.
I love somebody. All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody. And it's so easy. Why is it easy now?
I never felt so clean before.
You smell like baby powder.
Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I know already. We don't have to pretend now.
You don't need to do that.
Are you?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.
Hi.
Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?
I don't know.
Not exactly. It's certainly huge.
I bet you hear everything I say!
See, we're very modern.
There's just one thing. What about--
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. I'm so embarrassed I could die!
You decide, darling. Remember our budget.
Oh, Jim!
You can trust me, Judy.
I'm never going back.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Why did you do that?
So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Why?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids. Nobody acts sincere.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What? You still here?" Man!
No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody! Judy, what am I going to do? I can't go home again.
You cold?
You still pretty upset?
No--I was just--maybe--
It doesn't matter to them.
They'll be looking for you.
Goodbye! See you!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
The kids take me.
Yeah. So where's the high school?
Yeah--why--
Where's Dawson High School?
Won't mother be proud.
Who lives?
Where what was.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Now that's true!
Bully for you.
Hi.
It's all right.
He's dead. He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Talk to them! Heavens!
Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Oh, we can manage that! I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Okay.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing. I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof. His name's Jim. It's really James but he likes Jim more. People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Oh, I don't know. You have to get to know him. He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it. He's sincere.
Yes. My best friend.
Goodbye, Judy. Take it easy.
She's being called for.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street! I wasn't even near there!
I'll never get close to anybody.
No. I don't even know why I do it.
No.
I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life. I just hate it.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming. He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left. And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me. Then I ran out of the house.
Yes! I don't know! I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does. We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal. So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I don't think. I know. He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world. He doesn't like my friends--he--
He hates me.
He hates me.
Girls don't love their father? Since when? Since I got to be sixteen?
Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I was talking to Dad.
+++$+++ You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo. I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Didn't you forget something?
Good evening.
+++$+++ With us old creeps? Come on, we have to eat.
+++$+++ No. Why?
+++$+++ We were romantic then too--
+++$+++ We used to sing it in school. Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
He'll be dead when he does.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.
-- till he fucked his parole --
Searching for a money man...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
He wants... your "sister"...
He wants the money.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. Bury him all over the place.
You promised me!
Gabriel, you promised!
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Is this him!?
A man of some travels.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Must have a way with stationery.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
+++$+++ Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
+++$+++ We sell children's toys --
+++$+++ Toys for... adults?
+++$+++ You can't find... what?
You said it a million times!
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
What are you talking about?
What?
I'm glad it was me.
Who wouldn't.
You shouldn't have.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Yeah. That's love.
Well. I'm going home.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
They all are. Football's on.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
I'm almost done.
Part of... with them?
Nick, what are you talking about?
We'll need one.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
They'll have guns.
I love you, Nick...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
You saved me.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Nick, the ice is --
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing -- -- drink this for me.
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
Get your own room.
Get your own room, Ashley.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
They're truck drivers.
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down?
He working for them on this one?
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Gabriel!
...maybe I die for Nick...
Nick died for me....
Your pen palls dead, lady.
You're in on this.
You told him about Nick's letters.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You're not hearing me here --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
JESUS CHRIST!
I'M NOT NICK! You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
You sold him out.
You motherfucker.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
...the truck driver...
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
I'm not him. I... You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
NO!
I'll see what I can do.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Well, I don't know about that --
Beauty and fragrances.
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
You need a COAT!
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Ashley, Jesus --
Where the hell are you going?
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Tell me again.
Yeah. Me too. Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
No, not that, no... I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
No, c'mon --
No --
What.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
No, hey, I like your coat --
No, no --
Radio said.
Yeah.
Radio said negative five.
How'd you know my name.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How'd you know my name...
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
'Tis the season, convict.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
No gun.
No, you're not.
No way.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No.
NO.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
No, Gabriel... no...
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
NO!
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
Nnn... nothing...
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV. So we're gonna have a contest.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Don't tip.
I'm gonna need some money.
Get out.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
You do.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Might as well be.
More than you know.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
They won't recognize me.
You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe.
And I worked there. For a year.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
This isn't the Tomahawk.
I said, who the hell made the map?
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man.
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is. We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
The hell you don't.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
You knew the place --
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
What's her greatest fear?
Be more specific.
What college.
Bam Bam.
Samantha.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What?
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here. Get him back in the rig.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
I shared his cell!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick! I -- I just wanted to be --
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
The hell I can't.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
And where they hide the real money.
Leave the tree.
Take 'em.
GO!!!
OPEN IT!!!
+++$+++ He's not Nick Mason...
+++$+++ ...so where is he?
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
+++$+++ Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
+++$+++ I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
+++$+++ Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
+++$+++ I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
+++$+++ We're aware of your position.
+++$+++ We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
What?
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
Acid-chewer.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
How long ago was your makeover?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
You knew there were guns in here!
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
What about the money?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
What the hell was that about --
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
You want that for here or to go?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Oh, man --
It's a roach, guy --
I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
...for Christmas...
...be with her...
Tell Ashley... I...
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Ash... Ashley...
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Jesus, Rudy --
Alamo...
Standing right here, man!
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Good for you. Protein.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Oh.
She's using a new perfume.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
I'm just talking.
I'm just saying.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And some pecan pie.
Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do.
Hot chocolate.
Not yet.
Ain't there yet.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Haven't thought about it.
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Switch seats with me.
+++$+++ But... I had a five...
+++$+++ Well...sorry...
+++$+++ I... sorry, Mister...
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
They changed the layout.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Who the hell made this map.
I'M NOT NICK!
+++$+++ Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
+++$+++ I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
+++$+++ Alone at last.
I don't wanna lift crates.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! " I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Fine, now.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
+++$+++ How do you know all this?
+++$+++ It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
+++$+++ Was he all pissed off?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
+++$+++ Who?
+++$+++ You ain't dying, he is.
+++$+++ No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry? Vic was worried.
We can work this out, can't we?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
What?
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
+++$+++ No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
+++$+++ I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
+++$+++ The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once. "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
+++$+++ Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
+++$+++ We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why the hell are you beating on him?
+++$+++ Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
+++$+++ I don't know, but somebody did.
+++$+++ What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
+++$+++ Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
+++$+++ The cops were there waitin' for us!
+++$+++ We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
Tell me more about Cabot.
I can do that.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
What?
But what is this?
What?
What's this?
Didja use the commode story?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
The Brewers.
A little.
Me and Mr. White?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Who, Mr. White?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
+++$+++ Just hold on buddy boy.
I'm sorry.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
You can do some crazy things with it.
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch. When do you think you'll need me for real work?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more. Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
How is he?
Who's your parole officer?
Sure.
It's a change.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Wong?
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
+++$+++ It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Dead as Dillinger.
+++$+++ Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name... ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly. Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
+++$+++ Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
+++$+++ Don't ask me that.
+++$+++ Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
+++$+++ Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
+++$+++ Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
+++$+++ Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
+++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about?
+++$+++ What's the cut, poppa?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
What for?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
What's she doin' now?
+++$+++ Sorry, it's my book now.
+++$+++ Who gives a damn?
+++$+++ Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
+++$+++ You gonna put it away?
+++$+++ When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
+++$+++ For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
+++$+++ I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
+++$+++ Give me this fucking thing.
+++$+++ What's that?
Aren't you?
+++$+++ Nope.
+++$+++ He don't believe in it.
+++$+++ He don't tip.
+++$+++ Mr. Pink.
+++$+++ And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
+++$+++ Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
I do. How do I look?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Your name's Freddy something.
I know.
+++$+++ That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
+++$+++ He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery. What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
+++$+++ Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
+++$+++ Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
+++$+++ You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
+++$+++ For what, the cops?
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ Follow you where?
+++$+++ What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
+++$+++ You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
+++$+++ That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
+++$+++ What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
+++$+++ We think we got a rat in the house.
+++$+++ Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
+++$+++ You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
+++$+++ Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
+++$+++ I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
+++$+++ Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes. I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
+++$+++ Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
+++$+++ I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
+++$+++ Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
+++$+++ I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
+++$+++ Joe.
+++$+++ Correct.
+++$+++ Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
+++$+++ Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
+++$+++ Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
+++$+++ These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
EDDIE +++$+++ I'd go over twelve percent for that.
EDDIE +++$+++ I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
+++$+++ I don't believe in it.
+++$+++ Uh-uh. I don't tip.
EDDIE +++$+++ When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
EDDIE +++$+++ Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
EDDIE +++$+++ Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
+++$+++ Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
+++$+++ Not these guys.
+++$+++ Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
+++$+++ ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
+++$+++ He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
+++$+++ I told ya he'd be pissed.
+++$+++ You takin' his side?
+++$+++ You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
+++$+++ So you wanna git bit, huh?
+++$+++ This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
+++$+++ Is that supposed to be funny?
+++$+++ He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
+++$+++ You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
+++$+++ And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
+++$+++ We ain't taking him to a hospital.
+++$+++ Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows: what you look like, what your first name is, where you're from and what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
+++$+++ One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
+++$+++ Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
+++$+++ He asked.
+++$+++ I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
+++$+++ I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
+++$+++ Well, he knows a little about me.
+++$+++ I don't know anybody.
+++$+++ Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
+++$+++ Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
+++$+++ So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
+++$+++ Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
+++$+++ He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
+++$+++ I think he's just passed out.
+++$+++ He ain't dead.
+++$+++ Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
+++$+++ Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
+++$+++ Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
+++$+++ Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
+++$+++ So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
+++$+++ No shit?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
+++$+++ No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
+++$+++ I got 'em, all right?
+++$+++ I got the diamonds.
+++$+++ Nope.
+++$+++ Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
+++$+++ What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
+++$+++ At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
+++$+++ Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
+++$+++ I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close - to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
+++$+++ I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
+++$+++ Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
+++$+++ No real people?
+++$+++ Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
+++$+++ You're right, this is bad. How did you get out?
+++$+++ Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
+++$+++ As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
+++$+++ What's wrong with it?
+++$+++ Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
+++$+++ Want a smoke?
+++$+++ I'm cool.
+++$+++ What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
+++$+++ Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
+++$+++ You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us. You haven't thought about this?
+++$+++ This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
+++$+++ Oh this is bad, this is so bad. Is it bad?
+++$+++ Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
+++$+++ Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
+++$+++ Fuck all that.
+++$+++ So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
+++$+++ Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Look of things, she doesn't.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Nobody. The light was bad.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Maybe he did.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
+++$+++ Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
+++$+++ It doesn't matter who they are.
+++$+++ Tell them to come on in.
+++$+++ You don't know how good it is to see you.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Where you going?
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
It's going to Sonora.
I'm sorry.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
All my clothes --
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
All right -- it's said!
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Tell me, darling.
Maybe it's better that way.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
So that's it -- You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Why do you think?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Are we leaving?
He knows his alphabet.
Will she be dark or fair?
I'll make the soap myself.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
You should know. She's in your dream.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Hold on.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
They're stragglin'.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
He's learning his letters.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
There's a nice boy.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
You can stay here if you like.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Just about.
Yes, ma'am.
And this is Helen Carter.
This must have been in the family a long time.
What's the matter with her?
Anybody hurt?
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
So did I. They were in it.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
How's that?
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
I -- lost something.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
You'll live.
How's that?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
You want to split up? --
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
You know what she asked me?
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You better start.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or -- -- go back and watch the horses.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
Finished, son?
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
I won't again.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
That's right, Steve.
Good thing you didn't.
How'd you happen to miss?
Swimming.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Lednov.
Why?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
And meet him there.
All right. I'll tell you.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Yes.
This is an awful nice gun. Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
In a fight?
What was he in jail for?
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
I don't want to run short.
Like what?
A man I used to know.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
A little hot.
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
All right, you didn't know.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.
Three men on matched roans?
That's a good girl.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
I said I didn't care.
I don't care.
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Go away -- please.
Stop it -- stop it.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
But I want to stay.
It isn't that --
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
That sure smells good.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
They went on like I told you.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Some people who went by this way lost it. Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
There aren't any women here.
Yes, people make me restless.
Well, say it.
I don't like to see you go.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
They shouldn't have done that.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
Depends on how good you drive.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
I don't care what he thinks.
That's it then.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Go ahead. Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Maybe I better start working on him.
You're not giving up?
He certainly could. About a month.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
There's still tomorrow morning.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
Now where's she goin'? --
Maybe in Sonora.
I don't know -- I don't know.
Up the trail.
Clay Phillips.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Everybody knows --
Yeah, we sure have.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
I said let's go.
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got to get movin'.
What are you doin' --
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Steve --
Thanks, Steve.
It's a long ways yet. I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Let me do that.
She was only teasin'.
But you're his brother.
I was doin' both. Here.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
And you've got me all figured out?
Oh, I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
I feel good anyways.
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
How about California?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
What do they look like?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
And that's tough, isn't it?
Then I know my alphabet.
What comes after Z?
Aren't we stayin'?
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Good night, Steve.
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
You're so nice.
Maybe I could start you out.
Would you like to learn them?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on. Are you going far?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
No, I won't let you do it.
I think he wants me.
Wife?!
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Are you okay?
That's it.
Me, too. 101?
Do I know you?
Would you die already?!
Never happened!
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Okay.
Hey, I have an idea...
What?! What is it, a monster?!
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Ouch!!
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we have next?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Ray, run faster.
Where's Shorty?
He's right. I should go first.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
No, stay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Hello Ray.
Hot dogs.
What should we get?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Hey, look out, a bee!
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Then what are we going to do?
Oh.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Listen to me I --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Cindy, let me...
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Better try a little higher.
Feel that?
Can you feel that?
Shit!
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Huh?
Great!!!
I was thinking the same thing.
Yes...
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Let's get outta here.
Where the hell are we?
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Shhh!
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Okay.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Hi Buddy.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
No. I never date outside my race.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
That means more screen time for us.
Let her go, Cin.
So, whatever happened to her?
Thanks, I'll be fine.
What, you think I did this to myself?
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
Are you okay?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Where's Shorty?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Oh, right.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Noooo!!!
This can't be happening?
Both of them?
It was you...
Stop! --
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Stop touching his brain!
Hanson, please.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
I'm Cindy.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there. Nobody wants to go.
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
What are we gonna do?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
What the hell are you doing?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
No, my friends are right here!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Yes, we made it!
Father!
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
Did you do that?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Don't touch me!!
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
I don't like this, this...
I take it you're not mad at me.
Got a problem with that?
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
What are you getting at, Professor?
Theo, did you see the animal?
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Got my camera right here.
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
That's why we came here, remember?
What?
What is it, Dwight?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Professor, I think you should see this.
My God! Is she dead?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Would you please focus?
Professor!
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
In about fifteen minutes.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
How are we going to get them all up there?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
What's this?
Willing? I like that. And, this one?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean. Ooh, I like her.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Any of them hot?
Are these all the subjects?
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
I finished all the interviews.
She's right. We should stick together.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
And sexy.
You do.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Just a little experiment.
Hi.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
Yours, or the turkeys?
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman. Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
You're not wearing a belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
My help?
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine. I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Second best.
+++$+++ Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
+++$+++ How is she?
+++$+++ I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Father, come in, please.
+++$+++ No, I'm fine.
+++$+++ My holy water.
+++$+++ What she said about your mother?
+++$+++ Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Because she will lie?
+++$+++ Then let us prepare.
+++$+++ Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag?
+++$+++ Soon. First, I must bless this house.
+++$+++ Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Yo son, check this out.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
Aww. Cool. Dude.
Get out?! What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
No more violence... No more violence...
No! It wasn't like gore movies at all! IT WAS REAL!
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
You don't think...
Mother?
It's the influence of all those family films. Right, Mom? Hey, Mom??...
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
Did you hear?
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Oh, boy!
Hi, Mom.
BLOOD FEAST!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her! Should she be the next victim?
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
You said you hated him.
Jeeezzz!
He's really cute!
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
"Serial Mom"? WOW!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
Is there a killer loose?
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
I certainly did not.
Always the dentist.
+++$+++ Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
+++$+++ I don't feel like rewinding it!
+++$+++ Why?
+++$+++ There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
+++$+++ Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
This is so silly.
But, Chip...
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
You scared me.
God, Mom! What's the matter?
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Oh Mom...
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Oh God, really! This is the limit!
Chip, honey?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Hold on... Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
+++$+++ Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Bird books mostly...
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
+++$+++ I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Leave her alone, Chip. I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Oh, honey!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Amen to that. It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Don't wake the kids...
Shhhh..
You bring me such peace...
I love that you're my wife.
It's fine with me, Beverly. You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Goodnight, honey.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher. Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Chip, your ride is here.
No woman would!
Sorry, son. This is a matter for adults.
That's nice.
+++$+++ GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
...People who don't mind their own business.
Yes, I did.
What a mess.
I know Dottie!
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
+++$+++ Objection! Argumentative!
+++$+++ Who's voice was it, Dottie?
+++$+++ Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
+++$+++ Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
So you admit you just lied?
So you do drink?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up. I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
What did you just say?
It's not fair!!
COCKSUCKER!
GODDAMN YOU!
Alright, I'll try... "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Who is this?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
+++$+++ You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles! I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!! The prosecution rests, your honor.
+++$+++ What do you mean, you're not sure?!
+++$+++ Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
+++$+++ Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
+++$+++ State your name, please.
You got your wish.
0h, that's horrible, honey. I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's him!
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
He killed people, Mom.
And who may I ask is Carl?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Who wants fruit salad?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
+++$+++ Beverly, honey, you've got some... ...do-do on your shoe.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
+++$+++ That's like your car, Beverly,
+++$+++ Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
+++$+++ It's the least I could do. I heard shouting.
+++$+++ Beverly, are you alright?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Certainly not!
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He's a good boy.
Bon Appetit!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins. A little something I baked.
Right here!
Now, here's a babe!
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Yes you are.
You forgot something...
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
+++$+++ We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
+++$+++ How to send a bill!!
+++$+++ Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
+++$+++ What was that?
+++$+++ I'll take this instead.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Yeah —- sure.
Sure I do.
Listen ——
We can't stand here all night.
I'd like to get out of here.
No.
Yes.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
I don't like this.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Can we go there now?
You think my sister is there?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Where?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
You can?
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
Drink.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
No.
Yes, I understand.
+++$+++ No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
+++$+++ I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
+++$+++ Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
+++$+++ Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
+++$+++ She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
+++$+++ Oh, as beautiful as ever.
+++$+++ For the time being, I imagine that must do.
+++$+++ How much have you got?
+++$+++ She can only use cash.
+++$+++ She could use a hundred dollars.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
+++$+++ As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
What sort of danger?
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
What is it?
Do you know what this is, Frances?
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
She's a pretty good sort.
Redi's all right.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her. People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —- "The Dante."
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Hello, Frances.
Yes.
+++$+++ You fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
+++$+++ What did she want to know?
+++$+++ And that was all?
+++$+++ Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
+++$+++ What were you talking about?
+++$+++ What did she want?
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
Gregory —— you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Good night.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
What brought you down here, Greg?
The people at the restaurant?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
But you have treated me that way.
Drink your milk.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Afraid she might commit suicide? People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was. There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
Why?
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Not from me.
That you love Mary.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
We could tell him.
I don't know.
Well, that's illuminating.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
Well?
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
But I understand her. That may be more important.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I'm not joking.
I'm going to find your sister.
I don't know.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
No!
Who are you?
You'll be all right?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Please, Jacqueline.
I understand.
I keep telling myself that.
They may have been friends of hers.
What's wrong, Mary?
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
I have to go —-
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I can imagine.
Devil worshippers!
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I don't know.
I don't think that's so revealing.
But you're always at the library.
I have something even better.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
And you knew he'd be here.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Were you going to make a suggestion?
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
+++$+++ Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Bella Romari If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata. Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
+++$+++ Well, since, you're over twenty one——
+++$+++ Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
+++$+++ Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
+++$+++ Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules. When did you say you wanted them?
What?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend -- -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
Perhaps.
I think it's time.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet —— one as a detective.
Uh—huh.
After that wonderful first book —- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
What was she to you?
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Would they hurt her?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Cloven hoof?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Dr. Judd?
+++$+++ This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
+++$+++ But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
+++$+++ This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
+++$+++ Is it about Jacqueline?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Unless what?
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance. I don't know what her sorrow is, but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
But you would like to know where she is?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I don't believe it.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
+++$+++ It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
+++$+++ If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes.
I'm afraid not.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I didn't know.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
+++$+++ Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
+++$+++ Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
+++$+++ She's not been here for a long time.
+++$+++ Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-
+++$+++ I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
Of course.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
+++$+++ Have you any other relatives, Mary?
+++$+++ Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Yes?
When?
What?
Why
No, Nancy. You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
+++$+++ Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
+++$+++ What about Judd -- he knows about us.
+++$+++ I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
+++$+++ I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
+++$+++ I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
+++$+++ It won't hurt.
+++$+++ Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
+++$+++ I should have known. She had no sincerity —- no real belief.
+++$+++ Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
+++$+++ I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Graham...
I want to touch you.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
You're not answering me.
Why are you ashamed?
Come on!!
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
I can't tell you like this.
Because.
Don't do that.
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
I don't know.
Possibly.
Yes.
Not entirely.
I don't know. Possibly.
No.
Yes.
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
I've told you.
I can't.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
That's very flattering.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not planning on it.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
God, I m so mad at him!!
I'm babbling.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Don't you get lonely?
And now you can?
How come?
So you lied to her?
What was the problem?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you have had sex.
You said you weren't always impotent.
Can't or won't?
Why not?
On tape?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Have you fantasized about me?
About me?
About who?
So you do fantasize?
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
Why?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Do you want me to stop?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Did you have sex before you were married?
Is he going to see this?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Sometimes. Afterward.
When we're making love?
You are married, correct?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
It won't. Are you ready?
I have money.
Then do it.
What do you have to do to get ready?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Don't you want to make one?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Why didn't you tell me?
How did you know?
You know?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Maybe you want to go.
I'm sorry this came up.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Yes.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Everything about sex.
Yes.
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
No.
Yes.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
You went out with her?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Who's Donna?
What kind of personal project?
I can see that. What are they?
What are these?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Ann. Hello.
That's correct. Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Basically, yes.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
You had sex with you therapist?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
You're in therapy?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
Impotent.
Agreed.
Do you want me to?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Kids? What about them?
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
No.
Lawyers.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
I don't know.
Sister older or younger?
Thank you.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Nine years.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
You play an instrument?
No, not really.
Well...
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh, uh-huh.
Graham is an unusual name.
No. Why?
Television?
Oh.
Do you have other things?
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
False alarm.
Graham Dalton.
Ann?
God damn you!!
I have thought about it, yes.
You son of a bitch!!
Bastard...
Goddam right.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!! Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Where did you go when you left here?
Why?
What?
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I'm not either!!
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Something wrong?
Who'd you have lunch with?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
John?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Why?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Yes.
Not really.
Yes.
Yes.
I guess.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him. After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
What do you mean, like physically?
No, he left last week.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
What visitor?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you. I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
So it was recently that you tried this.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you masturbate?
Did you do anything?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
When did you begin having this feeling?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
What upsets you about that?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
No, I didn't.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Bye.
I get real busy between two and four.
Do you have my work number?
Thank you.
So what's my share of the dress?
I was just trying to --
It looks like a tablecloth.
What is it?
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
I feel like I do.
You couldn't do it, period.
Why?
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
No, but I did.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
He wouldn't do that.
I wanted him to see me.
Because I wanted to.
What!?
Yes, I did.
Apparently.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Questions about sex.
He just asked me questions.
Then why'd you call me?
Well, what, then?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Well, why?
Why not?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Fine.
I just thought it might --
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Lose something?
And what?
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
What?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Why, so you can go after him?
Why?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
There's a phone here.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
Did you take your clothes off?
No.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I would.
No.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
No.
Okay.
Hi.
He doesn't have to tell me.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Prettier than Ann?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like the way I look?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Then what happened?
What did he say?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Were you disappointed?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Your first sexual experience.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Do I sit or stand?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
How long will it take?
And you ask questions, right?
How do we start?
Would anybody else see the tape?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
And that's all?
You just want to ask me questions?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
About what?
Doing what?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
She still is.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
You want me to leave?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I know. Will you please leave now?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Who?
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Look, are we going to do it or not?
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
What do you mean?
You trust him.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
I just... Ann is very...
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
I wish you hadn't done that.
You told Ann about this?
Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Do you want me to stop calling?
Nothing wrong with trying.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Cynthia. John.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Right now.
I want to see you.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Not today. I've got other plans.
Hello.
John?
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
I'm intrigued.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Afraid of getting caught?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Who said I was jealous?
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
How about for five hundred?
Will you lease month-to-month?
No. You said three-fifty?
It'll just be me.
Shut up!!!
Answer him, goddammit!!
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Give me your keys.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
So is my wife, asshole!!
You know which tapes! Where are they?
Where are the tapes, Graham?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
I like having the car, the car is important.
What do you mean?
She held up very well.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
PHONE +++$+++ Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
PHONE +++$+++ Mr. Millaney?
PHONE +++$+++ One moment.
PHONE +++$+++ May I ask who's calling?
PHONE +++$+++ IBM.
He said immediately.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Mr. Millaney?
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Hi.
He'll be really mad.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
I see. Then what brought you up here?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
You knew these people?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
You're the one who found the bodies?
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
+++$+++ Down to the incinerator.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just... ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Well? Supper at my place?
Anything wrong?
+++$+++ Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
No. Dotty's the last.
Another kiss?
Kiss, kiss?
+++$+++ That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
+++$+++ Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK? I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
You say something?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Can I call you at the office?
+++$+++ It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
+++$+++ OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
+++$+++ Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now. What's your number? The number of your apartment?
+++$+++ Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
+++$+++ What happened?
+++$+++ Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
+++$+++ I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
+++$+++ Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
+++$+++ Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
+++$+++ Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
+++$+++ Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
+++$+++ Just breathe normally.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
Yeah. Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Huh?
Lemme clarify for you.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right? Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
That you, Rog?
+++$+++ OK. I'll think about it.
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me. They used to come here sometimes. Don't ask.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely. All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
+++$+++ I don't get it.
+++$+++ It's crazy.
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
+++$+++ But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
+++$+++ Well, at least you still talk the same.
+++$+++ You touch my spleen, Rollo. And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.

I tell you what's cooking. She made the blind see and it was a gift! Who was it from? Let's hear an 'F" for...
Sank you! Velcome! Sank you!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Check. The quacks are willing tools?
How's Brad?
Later, Brenda. Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
You bet, Bert.
You got it!
Congratulations! It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
You got it!
About Brad's family?
SIN-I-FUL
But...how?
When do I get to see Brad?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
On the contrary. He wants to see your ratings soar. He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Of course! D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know, I know, it's just...
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Introduce yourselves.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
I am in Farley's employ -- and... ...we're discussing a network deal.
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Show yourself. The real you. The secret you.
Who trusts experts?
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see. Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
SOLD??!!
SPONSOR!!!
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled. If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Really. What'll I pin this on?
He was a President.
In a little masquerade?
Care to indulge?
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Look. Look at that. Bert Schnick can see. Why...he's...dancing.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Yes, Betty.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
...closed?
Ah yes. Farley Flavors. You know, I find it...
It's happened before. Remember Lieutenant Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Bert brought them over from Europe. They had a very popular series together. It's still rerun in a lot of countries. You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front? What an ideal couple.
Everything's free there.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
No! I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
You too, Betty!
I'll leave you young things to it.
Not at all. You have your life. And I have mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
But I don't need treadment.
I'm not going, Janet.
I don't want to get up there.

Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Oh, Harry. What are we going to do?
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block. I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. And Hank says Danny's moved to New York. To better himself.
I'd forgotten.
Mental instability?
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Absolutely correct.
Sure thing.
He's a lame dog, remember? But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Who?
What do you mean?
I won't be a party to this. I want to see Brad.
But they only think they're happy.
Could I do that later?
You're practically naked!
Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
You shouldn't have said that.
Poor Brad.
Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show. The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Oh. Mom. It's Brad.
Don't worry, Janet. Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
Dentonvale...say, that's for... I'm sorry to hear that, Janet. Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
Vance! Vance Parker.
Hey! What are you trying to do? Get yourself committed?
I NEED SOME
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
Arrest that man! He's committed to our care.
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog. I've got a lot going for me. I'm going places. I'm going to be someone. I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it. I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you. I should be with my people...
Of course. He was in great danger of harming himself.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
You've got a really tight team around you. And everybody needs you!
He will. But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings. You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous. And Farley's given you that chance. You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
I want to see Brad.
Me?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
No...couldn't I do this later?
Good! Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Foods!
Fast!
Fabulous!
Flavors!
Farley!
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.

This is the nerve center of operations, Janet. You must stay here tonight. That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
That's an extremely negative response.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
Our field.
HE!!?? How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
Our speciality.
Ah. Mr. And Mrs. Majors. How wonderful to see you. I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Surely.
Hi! Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
We love you, Baby.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
We're not confused.
No.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
It's all in the wrist. You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
Bye.
Bye.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Why are you being so defensive?
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
So what's up?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
It's Christine. Hey you.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
So I guess that's it.
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
How's the trip?
Miles.
You okay, Miles?
Say, is Maya working?
Bottle.
Highliner.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.
What are you pouring tonight?
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Gary.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
She was good for you. And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Two years ago, buddy.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable. You boys hungry?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi. Maya's in the kitchen.
Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.
Me too.
Not so bad yourself.
Good. How're you?
I know. I might need to be spanked.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Stephanie.
That's what people say.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I am one of those guys.
Maybe. Recognize this?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
No, I'm an actor.
That's on us.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
You were wearing your belt.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Love you, man.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Why don't you come in?
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
You broke some.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Look at this!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What's wrong?
I'm fine. You rest.
You're so negative.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Want me to drive?
Yep. Quite a day.
Hrnrnrn?
Hold on.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
The plan is... you go.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Yeah.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
No way. No way.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
What?
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Fucking chick's married.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
You know what I'm thinking?
What's it look like to you?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
That's thoughtful.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Well?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Thanks.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Let me use your phone.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I don't have to.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Are they too sporty?
Do you like them?
We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. I want to go home.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Let's leave it alone.
It's private.
No.
Put me down, Jack.
Huh.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
You have to tell me --
What exactly are we going to do?
What's happening?
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
With Maya.
Is it the money thing?
I don't want to talk about it.
Throw me his ball.
Fucker hit into us.
What is it?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Shut up.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Huh.
Been checking your messages?
What do you think's going on?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nice shot.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Can you give me some room here?
Nope.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy. This is our day!
Yeah.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
What?
Besides what?
Does she know about Saturday?
What?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What're you drinking?
Hey, there you are.
What'd Christine say?
Right now.
You should call her.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad. It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Bathroom.
I'm fine!
Okay! Fuck!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
So what should I wear?
You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Well, she is cute.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
We're on.
Get the trunk.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
What do you think?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Miles.
Beautiful.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
So what's the plan today?
Fuck you.
Have you no shame?
Shut up.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
She works for tips!
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
And she likes Pinot.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Sure I know Maya.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Yeah. Tight.
Then it's a good thing.
If that's what feels right.
Uh-huh.
So you're going to stop acting?
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Whoa.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
It's not even a mile.
Just a minute!
Want some?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
Now.
That's what you do with every one.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
What do you smell?
Huh.
What color is it supposed to be?
Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all Pinots are noir.
This is rose, right?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
And get your bone smooched.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
You still seeing that shrink?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
That's your problem, Miles.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Um... seventy... something.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Oh yeah. Much better.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Sure is tasty.
Just tell me.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Oh, that's tasty.
Yeah.
Shut up. Here's to a great week.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Oh, Maya. No.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
What rehearsal dinner?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
About two-thirty.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Well, nice to see you now.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Okay. See you around.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Bathroom over there?
Yeah? Like what?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Sure.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
A paper?
Yeah. Thanks.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Um... yeah but it's more...
"The Day After Yesterday."
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Definitely.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, same here.
You got kids?
Is she sleeping or...?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Hey.
Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.
That's what I'm having.
I know. I love that.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Twelve months in oak.
Try it.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
See you.
The Windmill.
Good for you.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
You want to join us?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
See you over there, Miles.
I'm pregnant.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I guess.
I am.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
So what's happening with your book?
So how're you doing?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Ken.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Hello?
Where are you?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles?
Hello?
I told you I need a drink.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Good stuff.
French or American?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
How much skin and stem contact?
Stephanie! Stop!
See you, Miles. You take care.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Oops. Sorry.
Huh.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Where's Jack?
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Exactement!
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Uh-huh. I'll be right back.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
You talked to Wendy?
It was a surprise, Mom.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Daddy.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed. I'm letting go now.
This one?
This one?
She doesn't answer me either.
Does she ever answer back?
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Right.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
What's the matter?
Houdini's sick.
I'm scared.
I don't want you to die.
The same windows.
My ballet recital.
I heard them Morgan.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
I think it's contaminated.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I'm here.
...I will.
...I will.
Good.
Does it hurt?
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
Hi sweetie.
Five. The five longest.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
+++$+++ It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
+++$+++ I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Don't.
Graham.
Me too.
I know. We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
No.
How do they know it's over?
How many died?
They're broadcasting...
It's getting stronger.
I can feel air.
They're distracting us?
Merrill!
Merrill --
We won't be able to get out of there.
What are you doing?
They're right behind the door.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
This is going to do nothing.
They're on the roof.
Should we turn off the lights?
Chicken Teriyaki.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Where are you going?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Yes.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
How can you say that?
Do you think it's a possibility?
Morgan, be careful.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
It's noise.
Pharmacy crowded?
That roof is over ten feet high.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
I cursed.
No I'm not.
Explain noises.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
I'm not going to curse.
Explain, act crazy?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Did someone save me?
I can't even imagine.
They'll read our minds!
Stop crying!
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
What about Isabelle?
Where are we going to sleep?
Sounds made up.
They win.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Dad.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Oh.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Don't do it.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
It's old Morgan.
I have some upstairs.
Edgar, come inside.
Yes.
What did you say?
Pinned? What does that mean?
Why not?
+++$+++ Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
+++$+++ He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
+++$+++ You take care of yourself... Graham.
+++$+++ It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Six months.
No.
No.
I don't think so.
+++$+++ Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
+++$+++ Okay. So he was tall?
+++$+++ I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
+++$+++ You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
Sounds like a virus.
What was the first thing?
+++$+++ What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
+++$+++ There are none.
+++$+++ The footprints.
+++$+++ Sorry.
+++$+++ What's that?
+++$+++ It's the strangest thing Father.
What book!
Don't worry.
They think it might happen all at once.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Don't do it!
Is that him?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
No money, eh?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them... ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue. Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
I think we lost 'em.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
What friend is that?
You're in here for winging a guy?
...And you had to kill him?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
All I did was kiss a girl.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
All right then. Let's go.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
I didn't know you were out.
Emmett.
Gotta go.
Kate?
McKendrick's men got him.
I almost didn't.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Have to.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you. Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Sure.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
This time you're really going? You know where I'll be.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
How's Mr. Parker doing?
It's one thing to know it...
This is a brutal land.
Yeah... that must have been it.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
That's why I'm here.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
I just came out to say goodbye.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
They've been kind to me.
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
More than enough.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
My name is Emmett.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I'll be long gone.
I haven't done anything.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn. So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I've got a job.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Yeah?
I'll be around.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah... ...you know, lookin' in.
Anybody got any ideas?
All right, you buy me a drink.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
It's not going to be easy.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Women?
They got a saloon there?
What's Turley like?
Going to Turley, was it?
And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about. 'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. I surely do miss that hat.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
South of here, past Chimayo.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I had to get up anyway.
No, Leavenworth.
Not for five years.
You got no idea what they were after?
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here. Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm... ...just like you.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
Because they don't like what I want.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together. Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
Never will again.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking. McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
New record.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
All I did was kiss the girl.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
He is now.
He'll be here.
We wait.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
We didn't get that far.
Right!
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
You can't do this.
What are you talking about?
You wanted to see me?
Howdy.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them. Are these your friends?
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I was afraid of that.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Why him?
Why would they stop you?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Rae, I need help.
I don't have any family any more.
It's none of your business.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Who did it?
Daddy's dead.
Hello, Rae.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I got there just short of too late.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I heard that too.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
+++$+++ Good-bye, Paden.
+++$+++ What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
What's she got to do with it?
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
We didn't talk about this. They took the little boy, Cobb.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
What is it you want from me?
Well, thanks, but forget it.
+++$+++ Maybe you could run it without Stella.
+++$+++ I told you this was a sweet set-up.
+++$+++ I took out thirteen dollars.
+++$+++ Nothing like that will happen between us.
+++$+++ Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
+++$+++ What brings you into my saloon?
I just got to town.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
You're right.
You've got a legitimate job.
I've given that up.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
It's been a while.
+++$+++ Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
How about you?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
What makes you say that?
What do you mean?
He left me.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
What's this?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Here he comes right now.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
It's the only place I'm happy.
And I know what I'm talking about.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Stella.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I run the place. What can I get you?
+++$+++ He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
+++$+++ I thought you two would get along.
+++$+++ It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
That was my plan.
No!! I can prove it to you. I'll take you to her.
I am telling the truth.
It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.
Who?
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky. I'm just trying to understand. All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake. This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
I'm glad we talked.
Okay -- for you.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
We have a daughter together. I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone. I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I think he owes more to you. But that's not important now. I know what's going on between you two.
No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about. I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
No... it's life.
That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
No! Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me! Me! I swear, as God is my judge. You don't know what I've been through. Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me. Why do you think I've been wearing these? I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why? To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul. Don't you see? I made Simone!
-- She's a figment of my own imagination. I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Who says that -- ? -- Never mind. You have to listen to me, Elaine. Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation. I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine. Simone is not a real person. I invented her.
Not if I don't let her.
No. She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No, there isn't. There's nothing to her.
I would rather have you than Simone. Believe me.
I want you back too, Viktor.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards. I should be going, she'll be here soon --
I just read somewhere --
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
About now. Would you like a drink?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
She's lying down. She's exhausted.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And touching. She was spectacular.
Are you and Simone... ... getting married?
-- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
I'd love to. But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Really?
She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Viktor, you should have said something.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear. I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor. If you can't handle her, I will.
-- You can't go in there!
Everyone you know is lying.
Soon. Soon.
Thank you. I'll tell Simone you liked it.
You really think so?
Better late than never.
Who else? It's always Simone's idea.
I got them to remove the reflection. The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
I'll walk you out.
Which accounts for your percentage. When do I get to meet this dream?
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Even the fall from the plane?
There isn't one.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Al least a contingency for wardrobe. Any woman can go up a dress size.
She was in the theater? When? Where?
Hair and make-up?
Well, something has to be done about this budget. It's completely unrealistic. You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Really? Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Whatever. I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
No problem. Do you want to come in?
She's my actor. There are other studios, Elaine. There's only one Simone. Leave the press conference to me.
Out of the question. A circus like that?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse. That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Almost right.
Don't thank me. It was entirely Simone's decision. Do you have Simone's check?
Why? Because she would never show up at something like this. She's intensely private.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor. If they're good, they get known. And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse. I'm sorry, Viktor.
They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.
The picture's dead.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal. You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey. I called what's his name at Warner's. He said he'd take a meeting -- in July. I've fought for you Viktor... You want to talk severance?
You're not renewing my contract.
Spare me.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
We can hardly make a profit with them. Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy. We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars. We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date. When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Please.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children! Don't you see? We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
-- I'll tell you why. It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's. Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
No! You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Of course she is. No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Where are you?
Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.
Hello?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Well, I --
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
So you did meet her?
Because obviously she existed, right?
Just a minute.
It was a great show, Dad...
Sometimes. But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever. He took the credit for Simone tonight.
I have to talk to her.
Obviously, this can't last. She's going to dump him. Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive. It'll destroy him.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
You had no choice, Elaine. He's a liability.
"Why are we here? Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here? No why. Just here".
You're with me to be close to her?
Simone?
What I do to Simone?
What?... What did you say?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
You look so, so...
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er... ... scent.
Thank God for you, Faith. I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in. You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
That's true. I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time. Viktor bought me that time. I owe him so much.
+++$+++ -- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
+++$+++ What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
+++$+++ How about the nudity?
+++$+++ Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
That's a good question. As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real. Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
+++$+++ You don't secretly want the attention?
+++$+++ Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
+++$+++ Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone. Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
No. In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
I know what you mean.
Somebody said she was here.
Is she here?
How did the wall get there?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Why not?
But she's right there! I must feel her!
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene! He has to touch her. He has to!
For you. I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale. But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself. She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins. She's on the line now.
Body double.
You're so far off! Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star. Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight. Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction... I'll try to talk her into it.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
Really? She didn't mention it.
Clyde.
You never were together, Hal.
Hello, Hal.
It's a re-make, Hal. Anders is not bigger than this picture.
I'm already dead.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day. I'll call you about his next week.
You saw that?
You do?
What's that?
I don't know anything about computers.
That's the point, Hank. No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse. Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed. It can't be done.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
I need flesh and --
Come on, Hank. A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
I've seen them all before.
Don't be. It was worth it.
Good and bad. They think that's what caused this. Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen. It's the size of a grapefruit. Heavy too.
-- Eight years ago. In that whole time, I never left my computer.
It's me, Mr. Taransky. Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno. I was keynote speaker. You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I was misquoted.
You want me to call Security?
-- Please, get away from me.
I can't believe you people! No wonder she never comes to these things!
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy. We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
About you and mom?
There you go again, blaming yourself. Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you. You deserve better than Simone. I've got to go, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky. I liked you better before -- before all this. You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity. I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her. And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
-- I can't accept it. I don't want a car, Dad.
I know. Thank her for me.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
She did... didn't she?
I love you too, daddy.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
Too impersonal. They have to meet face-to-face.
I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out. Dinner, maybe.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now. She broke up with Kent.
You know me -- married to my work.
Hey, Lainey. How's your love life?
Good-night, Daddy.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Okay, Dad.
You were the one who insisted on it. Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I read.
I do.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I know plenty of boys.
Why?
Only her brilliance. To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck. You really pulled it off.
She's a miracle, Dad. Where did you find her?
Is she here tonight?
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I missed you. I wondered if you were ever coming back.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
This week anyhow.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell". But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Hello, Lainey.
I know you'll do it, Dad. You're Viktor Taransky.
You look very grown up. What are you doing? You meeting your mom for dinner?
It's really... not anything, Lainey. It's just --
Hello, sweetheart.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing! I strangled her! I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire! I did it! I killed her!
-- No! I can't go along with this horseshit! Just tell them they can fry me!
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
I could get the death penalty.
This should take care of Mother.
You love her, don't you, Max?
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
That won't be necessary. Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max. You got me.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
I traced her to a nursing home. A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
What now, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Abduction?
I'm keeping it in trust.
-- I bet you have.
She was never in New Mexico. She never left the studio.
It's bogus. You used an old library shot for the background.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
It's a yacht.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you? You look kind of "captive" yourself. While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist. Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer. Look it up.
They are alive, Sayer.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Don't you have a real story to write? Why aren't you in Latin America?
Do I know you?
I don't understand.
Is that why she left you?
We used to.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Mr. Sayer...
Long live the First Amendment.
I will when you're finished writing it.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure. You know I had something on Mother Teresa. But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore. I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take. But this Simone woman is good.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Dark?
Why?
Maybe he's talking to himself.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Yes, of course it is. You know you have a line here. Not a wrinkle. Actually, more of a dimple. I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You could play the lead.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said. I mean, you're really good.
Would you like me to read?
Thank you. It's not important.
Yes.
It wasn't working anyhow. The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film. I don't think anyone will understand it. I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
I had three other offers. I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Taller? What?
It's the biggest on earth! I swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
-- Nicola! How was your massage?
+++$+++ What if it catches on fire?
+++$+++ Is Miss Simone coming today?
+++$+++ No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Let's take it down a notch.
Simone, are you there?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Perfect. God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk. It's worth it. Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime? Well, I think we've done enough for today. You've been cooped up in there too long. How about you and me go out on the town? They're expecting us.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
VIKTOR +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about.
VIKTOR +++$+++ Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
You're right. You're right. Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist. That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
No. I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Yes. Yes, it is.
VIKTOR +++$+++ And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
VIKTOR +++$+++ I am the death of real.
VIKTOR +++$+++ Maybe he can.
VIKTOR +++$+++ You mean they buy it?
A star is...
Good morning, Simone.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
I just needed to do a couple of things. And I needed to tell you something.
Why did you leave me?
Why, Malcolm?
Are you calling me?
--My God.
Wow. They called you their son.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time. I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Don't step in the horse manure.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
+++$+++ On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
What?
Really?
Maybe.
I definitely won't.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I guess she did.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
You do?
You believe now?
Just help.
No.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
What happened?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Are you wigging out?
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was... I was a fake.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Don't fail me.
Soon. One week.
I have to.
I don't know, Cole.
I don't know.
Yes.
Them?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Never mind.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
What?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
All the time. They're everywhere. You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
They don't know they're dead?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
What makes you think that?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
I forgot myself.
Who me?
What?
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
What kind of words?
What'd you write?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
She died a long time ago.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
You said the "s" word.
Know what?
Why?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
He hates me.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Where should I look then, Cole?
You mean aneurysm.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
I guess they don't.
How do you draw now?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
If it's okay with you?
That's good.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
You use needles?
Congratulations.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Dr. Crowe.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
What were they hiding from?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
She wanted me to tell you--
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
What?
Got it.
You think I'm a freak?
What are you thinking, Momma?
They want me to do things for them.
Ghosts.
Dead people.
They scare me too sometimes.
Standing next to my window.
Yes.
Oh my God.
They did?
Yeah.
Tell you my secrets.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Maybe.
So who moved it?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Anything bad about me?
What are you thinking, Momma?
They're right here.
Stuttering--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
+++$+++ How did you--?
+++$+++ What--
+++$+++ Excuse me?
+++$+++ I don't know how else to look--
+++$+++ Like what?
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
They used to hang people here.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
+++$+++ J. C. Penny's?
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
...He doesn't get invited places.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Superstition.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
What are you talking about?
+++$+++ Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
+++$+++ 'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
+++$+++ Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
See?
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
What's a "little while?"
Alright!
+++$+++ You're standing in horseshit.
+++$+++ I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Suzie???
Aha. The Lovers.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
...Hi.
Which street corner?
Someone actually... employs you?
Not according to these.
Bitch.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Tramp.
Slut.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Not someone -- Mac.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
How would you know? You're looking at my tits. Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Looks like the alternator.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Sounds familiar.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Gene.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
"Peggy-Sue" --
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
I could. You sucked.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
He means moon shining.
"And a slash-slash there --"
"-- an AXE!"
Metaphysical question, man.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Manure... is life.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
You're out of your mind, man.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Curt Cobain.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
It's time to make amends.
-- It's not me!
That's your grandfather you're talking about! I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Sure. What do you want to know.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
You'll be back.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away. Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Pardon?
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
You know who I am. You invited me.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
What's wrong?
-- By way of my breasts?
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Throw me one.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Who you callin' "boy?"
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
The audience!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Never.
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
No. Not without you --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Don't look.
Suzie --
Listen to me --
No --
Suzie... No.
You're... limping.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
You never had trouble communicating before.
Mmmm -- so can I...
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Getting ready.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
Let it go.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Nah. Just you.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Name something.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Yeah?
What'll we do?
Why bother?
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Carl.
Where's Mac?
-- Where have you two been?
Second verse!
Like your guitar break.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
What is it?!!
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
And that makes you look like a squid?
What?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
How are you going to find him?
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
'Mornin', Jack.
Shit.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
And this is mine.
You took Bill.
Okay.
Aspirin.
Yeah. Good.
No, Starla! No!
What?
What are you doing?!
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
That wasn't a good night, no.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
No reception out here.
Starla, it ain't --
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
How about Brenda?
No. What…?
Hey, Grant.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Oh, yeah?
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
Pretty, ain't they?
What you up to?
Whatcha' doin'?
That's not funny.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Shelby!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
We're coming your way, man!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Don't worry, Chief.
Hey there, Chief.
I got to leave my post.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Are you nodding?
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
What?
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Shut up.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Hell, I was game!
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Megan Halesy' little sister.
All the rib eyes?
How many you need?
What can I do you for?
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Grant, you're sick!
Grant, no!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
You're pretty.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Welcome home.
I never danced in a towel before.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Where are you going?
Flip.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Through a wound on his stomach?
What other stuff?
Margaret.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Hey, look!
Gold--digger, huh?
Your what?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
What do you think?
You paying for the gas?
How much style?
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
What's he get if he wins here?
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
See ya, Bandit.
What are you thinking?
Absolutely.
That man is your father?!?
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Hey...
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
One to five?
Why are you stopping?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
What kind of a guy is he?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
My very words.
And?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Ummm?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
I'm proud of you.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
How do you know?
Then let's change the subject. What do you think about forced school busing?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Uh-oh.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Mississippi's the other way!
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You could've asked.
Yeah.
I would've come back for you.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
He's after us again!
Ciao.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time. Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Eleven.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
We lost him.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas. Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Shoot.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
You just passed your nemesis.
Guess what?
Seriously?!?
Where you from?
You have a great profile.
Driving, talking to me...
Is this fun?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Well?...
So tell me about yourself.
A what?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
+++$+++ You sure do.
+++$+++ I'll do it.
+++$+++ I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
+++$+++ Yes.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.
Another time.
That's me.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory. Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
What's that, pardner?
I'm cucumber cool.
I'm here.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Let's boogie.
Talk to me.
-- How we doing?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You okay?
We'll be waiting. Over.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
I'll believe it when I see it.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Now what?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
Never mind. It's nothing.
We're gone.
Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise?
Then don't.
I ran into complications.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool. Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
What's your twenty?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
Bandit?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
This is Bandit I, come back.
Clear and rolling.
I hate to say I told you so.
We still on schedule?
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
They're jammed!
Can a pig whistle?
Redneck heaven.
Let's keep it that way.
Shit! No one's here.
He's history.
Loud and clear.
Why are we doing this?
Bandit?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
What are you doin' now?
Also boring.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
How long's this gonna take?
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
No.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner? Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
How'd you know?
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Cledus.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Pick it up, Breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker. Breaker.
Have any trouble getting here?
Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom? Excuse me.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
How's your twenty?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Who's Fred?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
This is Bandit I. Over.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Five thou.
Now, you just find him, son.
That's the point, Dickey.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
+++$+++ -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
+++$+++ -- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
+++$+++ -- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
+++$+++ -- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
+++$+++ -- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
+++$+++ Of course. Yes.
+++$+++ No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
You have a butler working that floor?
What kind of personnel?
-- so you shut them off?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
No.
How bad?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Get a coroner's estimate too. -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level. Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
No rest for the wicked. Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this? Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Anything on the Swede?
+++$+++ Yeah.
+++$+++ Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
+++$+++ Uh, yeah.
+++$+++ The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
+++$+++ -- he was wearing one of our jackets.
+++$+++ Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Wait a minute, what other agent? What other agent?
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Two of 'em?
But there were more of you?
And this is your car, isn't it?
And threw us into the lake.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
...I forgive you Darwin.
+++$+++ I'm here, where's the car?
+++$+++ No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
+++$+++ There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
+++$+++ -- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
I'm not doing cocaine.
...About what?
+++$+++ Yeah, why.
Then what --
I been accused of worse. What do we got...?
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I? Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Yeah, we've been through that.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
So I guess you're not going.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
What happened?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Without peer?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out. Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz... And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket. So y'got semen, human ejaculate -- -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
Look at the collar on that coat...
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I left him a message.
I said I got his machine.
I got his machine.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out. You'll walk with me.
+++$+++ ...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update. Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed. ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
They what? What? No. No. Why?
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want! Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us... The way they betrayed him...
...So you knew all this and yet y--
You're trying to save Sparazza?
I wouldn't go that far.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...holy shit... that's Heller... Isn't it?
...Yeah, fifty-three.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...Are you insane?
...When did you know all this?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...He does now...
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
And you just figured that out? The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
-- You can and you will.
-- no, we need to handle it now.
My debrief --
Where's Israel?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen. We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe. It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
How are we on time...?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
So how we lookin'?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
No shit.
Shoot.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Wow.
... Jesus... what for?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
-- okay, g'head --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
I'm here.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
You got clicks, anything?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
+++$+++ What were you doin' here anyway?
+++$+++ I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever. You gonna lemme see your scars?
+++$+++ That takes some of the sting out.
+++$+++ True?
+++$+++ For real?
+++$+++ It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch. I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
+++$+++ My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask? You hurtin' pretty bad?
+++$+++ No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
+++$+++ -- never in a million girl --
+++$+++ Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
I DON'T KNOW!
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
What's wrong?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What'd you say?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets. Plus you stank.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
What!?
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
I'mma grip and rip girl. I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone. Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
What are we talkin' on the split...
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
What else did Padiche say?
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Bulllllshit...
A puppet.
You're not Gibarian...
I can trust Rheya.
It can. Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected. Everything else, disintegrates.
You're being tricked. Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors. He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field. Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her. Understand something: I am the real Gibarian. Just a new incarnation.
Gibarian.
Where's Snow? Did you call him?
How quickly?
Whose side are you on?
It's not human, Kelvin. Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that. Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win. I want humans to win. So I am killing it before it kills me.
No, she won't.
Kelvin, she begged me. I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters. She walked into it and disappeared. She was gone.
Not her. It.
Why did you agree to come here?
Yes.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
We're done. Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow. There's something wrong with him.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is. I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Her? Who are you talking about?
Where's his body?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now: What happened to him?
I want to hear your version.
What happened to Gibarian?
You have to give me your word you won't come in. Then I'll come out.
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
I won't be making the trip.
You do, you don't. She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it. Don't you see? No, you don't.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself? Her? Which her, this one or that one. Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Yes.
Just get him to stop.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
No.
She knows everything. She knows who she is.
Get out --
She drank liquid oxygen.
That's right. And we all have to sleep, eventually.
But they are human. They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own. DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough. They build up with experience.
Perhaps it did.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right? Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth. We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying. Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Not necessarily.
-- we are not sure of that. We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean? I don't think so.
Why?
What is it?
That's ludicrous. This is contact. We have found God. The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth. So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long. You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
What will you say?
I wish you'd told me.
Will she come back?
Rheya.
Dead?
I'm not sure. It started with Gibarian. He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door. He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there. By this time, we were getting visitors, too. He was desperately trying to figure it out. Day and night. Who was she?
Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition.
I told you, try to stay calm. You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
That depends.
How much sleep?
Oh, that's a relief.
She was real. Where did she come from?
Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.
Is there anybody else here?
He'll let me in.
Where's Sartorius?
I love chocolate. I realized just yesterday how much I love it. I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
He's dead.
Shhhh. Just stay with me. Stay with me. Everything is forgiven. Everything.
You must have been dreaming.
When?
Please. Don't.
I don't know. Something. Anything.
A sleeping pill. Do you want yours?
I don't know anymore. All I see is you.
It put you here. I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream. I saw your mouth. And there you were. Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter. The decision we make now is all that matters. Stay with me.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I think they help.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that really what you want?
Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.
Yes, you are --
Who are you, then?
You exist here. I keep telling you.
I want you here.
Then you won't make it.
I can't stay here.
I never said I didn't.
Neither did I.
Thank you.
You should have told me.
I want every second I can get with you.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
No.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya.
Rheya --
I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.
How can I tell? You've seen both of me. I only know what you're like here. You're all I know. There is no "You" from before.
Don't. I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
What's happening to us?
You said he was dead.
What's wrong?
Do you?
Not this time.
Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. That's all I know right now.
Rheya.
I'm just as human as you. I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
You're the coward.
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.
I love you, too.
Was she right?
Why did she do it?
But we fought.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Sartorius.
That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different.
Stop.
What's wrong.
Yes. Yes.
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
He has a point.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
What does Snow think you should do?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
How could she not be real? I can smell her, taste her. She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
Good. Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Why did you say those things?
What happened to us, exactly?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you. I loved it so much, that feeling.
Scared. No, not scared. Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up. I was a threat. Now I know why. She was afraid she'd be seen. That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right? I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on. I guess that's part of the reason why --
Seven, eight. So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger. Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states. Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped. Freaky stuff.
Where've you been?
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
As I said, then it's God, right?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You still don't believe in God?
Then it's God, right?
Is it intelligent?
Is it a planet?
Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
What do you remember?
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
You talk like an actor.
You go home.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on? Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You want to fuck her?
And tonight?
You didn't look very happy.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Book?
I want you inside me right now.
Yes.
To calm my anxiety.
What are they?
I don't know. I can't be alone.
Don't.
I'll go with you.
Yes.
You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.
Fuck me. I knew it.
I'm not Snow.
Gibarian was helpless. It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
It's an experiment.
We want to talk freely.
He won't.
He won't do it.
Occasionally.
It's terrific Win.
Looks a little constipated to me.
And so what's with Steinhart? Is it serious?
Skiddy and Kit? I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Claire!
Say goodbye, Mike.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I don't know...
So.
Yeah. It's all over.
Mike...?
It's Venza. He wants you. You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Yeah...
"To"... Forget about you.
Long enough.
... Don't explain.
I know.
I know.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Do you?
What a memory.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really.
Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Pretty far. I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Are you okay?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
You don't want to know.
What do you want to do?
You told her?
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? A fuckin' joke?
I don't know you...
They called here after you left...
More bullshit! More bullshit! What kind of odds are they giving me? There must be some kind of office pool. One month? A couple of days?
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
Let go!
Claire...!
Claire, will you calm down?
And then what? I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country! You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail! And you knew that all the goddamn time!
You put me life in danger.
I can't open it.
What do you want?
Sleep good.
Yeah. I liked being around you too... Claire.
I'll miss you, Mike...
He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best.
Tell it like it is.
You don't like him, do you?
Very nice.
No dog.
No dog.
Yeah.
Yeah. It was.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew. She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Absolutely. Look at this.
Yeah, I like that! Where you go, I follow.
Could be, I guess.
No kidding.
They're kind of fuzzy.
How did you know?
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
Yeah, what a woman.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Claire?
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Sooner, the better.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Listen, that was my fault.
Yeah.
I came on at 8:00.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Let's get a drink.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Put it on my account, please.
Beg pardon?
No, Ma'am.
Nice. Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School.
You live in Manhattan?
What did he say?
Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
I'm supposed to call in.
Right. That's true.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Uh...
Hi.
Straight ahead.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
You're planning to speak?
Hello, Claire. How extraordinary that you came.
What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
And I'm making mine.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
Tommy...!
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Nothing.
Me neither.
I'm all right.
No.
He'll live through it. They all live through it. What a world, huh?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days. I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What's the difference?
You talked to his wife?
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. I'll talk to Garber about it.
Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep. You don't have to make conversation with me.
I watched TV.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
You gotta get another tour. We're gettin' too old for this.
What're you talking about --
You heard me.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
Did you hear what I said?!!
It is my fault! I'm responsible for her!
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago. It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I'll be right up.
Few minutes. Want to catch the news.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
She bought it.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I had to follow her to a store.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
It's not your taste.
Where'd you get the tie?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
I'd identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals. I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
She's got to identify him.
Honey. You got him.
What shit, honey?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
Okay?
I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Hey. The neighbors.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi... ... crummy. I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
For how long?
So how'd it go?
You got no idea...
You got a great ass! I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Get in bed.
What are you talking about?
Your what...?
What?
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
What do you think? Any chance? There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
They're operating on him. He's still alive.
What about when she identifies him?!
Even Joey Venza?!
It wasn't a bad bust. He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
What about when she goes out?
Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job.
I just sat and listened.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike. No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
No, I need'm now!
Koontz! I need you guys!
Call a cruiser!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
It was my fault, T.J. Fuck!
Be happy. He's good at this.
Yeah! Seniority gets the day shift.
Do it, or look for another profession. That's a choice I guess.
Bad fuckin' news. Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands. But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried. It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Right behind you, T.J.
THING +++$+++ Erect. You know, a "boner?" I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
THING +++$+++ Does it make you... hard?
THING +++$+++ Ever shot anyone?
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
No, I will not step outside.
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Don't tell me he's "busy". I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I asked for the man in charge...
Are you in charge here?
Watch your step!
Under the table.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
I'm not lettin' no one go.
I get my hostage first. No one's turned loose until I say so.
Koontz! Let her come in! Claire! It's pitch dark in here! You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall. Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'll prove it!
I brought the girl. She's outside.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say. Joey. I want to help you out of this.
Take care, pal.
Tommy! The guy's a sleaze-bag. She can't sing.
Shooting?
So, what are you doing tonight?
No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're gonna pass the street.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company. He thinks she's got a great voice.
She's taking singing lessons.
Mom and I got plans.
Okay, I guess.
Yeah, I think so.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Lay back, Mack!! What's this "lay back, Mack?" Where does he get this?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere! I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
How do you know where the gun is?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Let me see.
Be nice.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend. Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
I'm always here, Pete.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
No, no.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
S'funny. When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
I know. Still thinking about retiring?
You stop him?
Same old stuff. How's the pharmacy?
No. No, that's okay.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Or was it all a dream?
I was there.
Flash, drop it--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Flash, get lost.
Mistake? Hey, guy, get back here!
Hey, guys. Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Mm-hmm.
I am not pitiful! I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Great idea. Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
I know. I've got one too.
Let me guess. The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Harry…
Harry!
What's in there?
You maniac. You'll blow your scholarship.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
How are you doing, kid?
Are you okay?
Lemme down, bugface!
No! Now get outta my face, kid.
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs. Did you get pictures?
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them. Did you get pictures?
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em! I can't print this surreal garbage!
I got a question, college boy. What the hell am I supposed to do with these!? I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get? Salvador Dali! When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I like enthusiasm. That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids. Not just 'cause they work cheap.
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker. I do.
Can't focus...
Can we make it a hundred?
Yeah--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Come on, that's pure luck! The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Too hip. Your photos suck, kid.
Oh, that? It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest. Bye.
Frmpph-yrr.
Police, help! Po-- mmph.
I don't submit to blackmail! The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Deal. But don't tell anyone. I want to keep a low profile.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
How about tomorrow?
A spider. Eight legs.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight. Bright colors. Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Just about. See, I also have this amazing strength.
Just about. You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Well...
Thanks, I already ate.
Just call me Spidey.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Some things you should say anyway.
Maybe I was hiding. For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide. In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place. But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Nah.
Why?
Hm. Well, I like you, too. I like your aunt. I like your shoelaces. I like--
Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
I'm here...
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is… what's underneath. The part she was protecting. There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Ssh. I always thought she was a strong person. She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
Am I? I'm not so sure. I used to be sure of a lot of things. Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
You'd feel what?
Well, no.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done. That's a lie. I could've done something. If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Do you mind if I come too?
That was then. I'm better since the lobotomy.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style. Hey, look-- let's go to lunch. Someplace nice for a change.
Sort of. I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
That wasn't clever. That was just nasty.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's your problem?
I'm sure you kept warm.
Hi, Adele.
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
What are you doing this weekend?
I'd never admit that.
Does it have a human name?
"Flash," Liz. You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
But you like that in a man?
What?
I suppose.
My my.
Maybe. I could have stopped it, though.
Back to the lab. Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
No. I was lying about the coffee.
I hate--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I-- uh--
Huh?
It's too early to be clever.
Good morning, Liz.
Roz? Rosomoff? What is it?
Any sign of our friend?
Peter-- my condolences.
No such thing as coincidence. "God does not play dice with the universe."
Of course.
You sure about all this?
Toxic dumps, huh.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock?
You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room.
How is he?
Aunt May, what happened?
It's fine. Tell me what--
See? You big dullard.
Use a fork.
Absolutely no class.
Oh, not that. You promised you'd burn it.
What the hell is that?
The record--
Yes. Do you have a date?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Ick. And those foul chemicals in the pots--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard of new wave?
That's the understatement of the year.
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Hi. I've got sort of a hypothetical question. Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Doubtless. And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work. Somewhere else.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary. Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century. With more power, I could--
Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Ha. Anti-gravitational particles.
Truth. Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Oh, Roz. My mind is so far beyond yours now. I could beat you at chess now.
No. It isn't.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Creation? Or its opposite?
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Ach, theories! This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
I left a paper in my desk.
No. No thank you. I have work.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
The paper, my boy. A solid B-plus.
You never know. Go get some sleep.
Really. I'd like to speak with him.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Need any more help?
Not a lot. I saw inside of the Science Center. What exactly happened?
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Really, Professor, I--
Actually, I got this spider bite…
An extension on that astronomy paper? Because, uh...
Hi, Professor. What's up?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then. Bye.
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
So they're airing this tonight?
Like it?
No, no! Not there!
Sure, in the war. Pull those cables--
I'm not so happy myself.
Phooey on that.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Just drop me off here.
Bonkers.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it?
The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Imagine how I feel.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey. Lucky you showed up when you did.
Right. Let's go.
I sent for the police. We can explain.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Plenty.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Is you all little Adolfs?
Is you all good Nazis?
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Take some matches, see? And a cigarette, see? Tuck the cigarette in like this, see? Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Coming up.
Okay. Move on.
Ready?
Come on!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
There's only one pair left.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Thanks.
Why not?
Take it.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
A little something what?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Private property, bub.
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Then we're all in on it?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
How did he get over there?
How much more do we have to take from him?
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Okay, Security -- what happened?
I'll call the whole pot.
You are talking crazy!
Which one of you is what?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Don't wear it out!
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
What are the chances busting out of here?
It's on me.
Yeah.
Not you.
Sefton!
My legs are frozen.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Twenty-five.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
+++$+++ Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
+++$+++ You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I'll live.
105-353.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
+++$+++ The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
+++$+++ They also smell of moth balls. When were they issued? This morning?
+++$+++ Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
+++$+++ Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
+++$+++ Isn't it?
+++$+++ Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
+++$+++ I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
+++$+++ And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
+++$+++ Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
+++$+++ It is.
+++$+++ Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
It's a mouse trap.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Droppen Sie dead! Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
You should live so long.
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Jawohl!
Then droppen Sie dead!
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Say, Schulz --
No. I want to draw.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
Betty! Betty!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
May I have this dance, Miss?
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
You're crying, Animal.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
I'll open mine now.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Do Grable.
Grable, not Gable!
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
That's what I wanna hear.
What do those broads say?
Harry -- I'm blind!
She'll never forgive me!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
So what? There's other women!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Thanks. You're a real pal! What're we goin' to do with it?
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
No?
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
Let me go!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Lay off! The blonde is mine!
Look at me! I'm your baby! Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Shut up, Animal!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Wait a minute. We have some rights here. Why is this man being taken out?
+++$+++ ...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Yes, sir.
+++$+++ Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
+++$+++ Anything else?
+++$+++ Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Any objections, men?
We've all done a poor job of it.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
What about Schulz?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What are you going to do?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
Not yet.
You're wasting your time, Duke. Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
What radio?
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Shoot!
What's the decoy?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas. Let's have that civilian stuff.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head. Sprechen sie deutsch?
You did!
You told them, Hoffy.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Anybody cover?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Lay off, Sefton.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Says who?
Are we boring you?
A little weak today.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Oh.
Yeah?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
You can tell Father Murray to --
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland. Am I boring you, boys?
What time?
Shut up! Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Ach so!
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Are you questioning me?
Thirty-fifth.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
What about the radio?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
I'll tell you how come. The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Ich weiss alles.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Give me the radio.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day. Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here. Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
No! No!
Yes, you do!
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Here. Take them.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Fine -- fine!
Good morning, Sefton.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
You heard him.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Have a nice time over there?
You must have been some tail gunner! Go ahead, Cookie.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Is it all right if we smell it?
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Target their Bridge.
Where is he now?
He is.
Where is he?
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
HoS qorDu.
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Captain=8A
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Commander.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
And destroy every planet in the system.
That's where he's going.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
This is its current position.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
When is it expected back?
One minute to warp core breach.
+++$+++ We better get you back to the ship La Forge to Enterprise.
+++$+++ Data, are you all right?
+++$+++ Data, this isn't the time.
+++$+++ I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
+++$+++ You get what?
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Agreed.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
Is she still angry?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
You did it, Kirk! Damage report, Ensign.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
We're within range, sir.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
Yes, where would you go?
Why would you want to leave?
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Wherever he wanted to be.
All of us.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
You're in the Nexus.
But why destroy a star? Thank you, Guinan.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
It won't be installed until Tuesday. Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
We don't have a tractor beam.
No, no. Thank you.
Oh, of course.
Please, please.
It's our pleasure.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
Close to retirement?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
Antonia?
Better?
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Yes, yes, it is.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
I always do.
Where are the deflector relays?
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
A photon torpedo?
I thought you might.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Phasing? To where?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
And what would that be, sir?
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
I'm not going Scotty, help me with this chute.
Oh
We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say? Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Maybe they're not out there.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
No. Thank you.
Understood. That will be all.
Thank you, Number One.
Is there a problem?
Hmm, Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Sir?
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Captain, are you all right?
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
The Nexus.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one. Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The thought had crossed my mind.
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Nothing for me. I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Doctor Soran?
Aye, sir.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds. Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
It looks like we're too late.
The royal...studs?
+++$+++ Transwarp at your command, Sir!
+++$+++ Tractor beam, aye!
+++$+++ Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
+++$+++ All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning... I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Still no response, sir.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...? Chekov, break radio silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Response?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
On screen.
Locate.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Not from here, no.
Why don't we beam it up?
I don't believe it...
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
I went wrong.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
Hello, sir. It's David.
I'll go...
I still don't...
I don't understand.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
This planet is aging in surges.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Not exactly.
I have already made one transmission too many...
That may be difficult...
Logic indicates that is the case.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Spock's burial robe.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
David --
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
I'll handle that later.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
... Fascinating.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature -- Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Like your father... so human. All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel. Go.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
How many more?
What's wrong?
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally. My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas. Be tolerant.
Mr. Scott...
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
My God...
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
What? What are you saying?
Goodbye, David.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The ship... Out of danger...?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
You would have done the same for me.
Yes. And I know you.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Go, Sulu!
Come on!
What about surface life signs...?
With some on the planet...
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
... A cloaking device?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
I'll need it, Sulu.
The word is no. I am therefore going anyway.
She's to be decommissioned.
Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous. All my hopes.
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Would you look at that?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
No, sir, no response.
Any time.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
As surely as if it were my own! Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Genesis, I want it.
But, why?
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too? Surrender your vessel!
Wait! Give me a chance --
David?... David!
Who is this?! How dare you --
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Report status!
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
What I have done, I had to do.
What about Spock?
What you ask is difficult.
What must I do?
Bones!...
Yes... But -- how...?
I see... and I understand. Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... Or the one.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
He asked you not to grieve...
... He spoke of your friendship.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
"Met his death"? How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew. Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
How can you tell that?
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Good. This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want -- There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Sir, may I suggest --
Success, my lord.
Understood, my lord.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I... That -- is the real dishonor.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Put him on screen! Study him well.

Wait!... Wait...

Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Yes, my lord!
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
All true.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
How is that...?
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
Until now.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Now that's what I call a meal.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
I can spare me...
Khan could be down there!
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
It never rains but when it pours --
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Shore leave, Admiral.
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
And who am I hiding from?
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Thank you.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Exactly. Happy birthday.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I'm not a drama critic.
Physician, heal thyself.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>! Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
I still don't under --
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
You did this -- in a day?!
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Jim please --
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... Can't read you... repeat...
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
David. Please.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
So are we, it looks like.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
Mother, go back!
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Who --
Does that about do it?
Maybe...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I know, I know...
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
What do you want with us? I demand --
Never mind! Hurry!
What's the matter -- ?
Ssssh!
There's an air-lock.
You're crazy -- !
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
You know what she'll say...
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
I see. Helmsman?
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
Mainly. And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
That makes two of us. Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Are you running away from me?
I don't mean to intrude.
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
How soon --
What?
We appear to have plenty of time.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
I'm Doctor Marcus!
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I don't know.
Oh, I believe it.
The Admiral's son.
Only half of you would get there.
I shall avenge you --
Raise the shields...
Tactical!
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Departing dark side, Regula.
Well?
No!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
They won't --
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
They're still running with shields down.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Thirty seconds...
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Genesis, what's that?
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he... ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it? I never thought to see your face again.
+++$+++ I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
+++$+++ Just barely, sir.
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Scotty -- what's left?
We'll be going to warp speed --
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I. Mr. Scott?
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond! Nothing, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
... No response, sir.
Admiral --
Scotty, let's have it.
Spock?
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Try the emergency channels...
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
He'll die -- !
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Aye, sir.
Give the word, Admiral.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
+++$+++ Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Yes, Spock.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
The word is given: warp speed.
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Yes, SIR.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
... the good of the few...
The ship -- out of danger?
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Best we could do in two hours.
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Be careful, Jim...
Aye sir --
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
It's all we've got.
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Too late --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
They knew just where to hit us.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
What's she doing here?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
It literally is Genesis...
Carol Marcus --
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
How far?
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Or the one.
I would not presume to debate you.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Home.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
+++$+++ Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Kirk here.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Admiral on the bridge!
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir.
Distance from Reliant...
Time!
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Cease fire. Look sharp.
All stop, sir.
At what.
They just don't want us going in there.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
<u>WHAT</u>?
How?
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Admiral?
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Erased...
Phasers on stun. Move out.
There is no such regulation.
We're finding it. Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
HURRY.
Who?
Energize defense fields.
Take the test again.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
That was a little joke.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
I failed to resolve the situation.
I did not think so.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
May I speak, sir?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
... No, sir. It has not.
Because... there was no way to win.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners. Captain.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Battle stations.
Try again.
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Phasers locked...
Scotty!
Trying, sir!
Visual.
Engage warp engines --
Stop engines.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
I really must thank you.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Prepare for warp speed.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Shields activated!
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Aye, Captain.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
You lied.
Certainly...
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Aye, sir.
Never, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
No power to the weapons system, sir.
... They do, indeed.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
You do this -- for friendship?
Where must you go?
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Gillian --
Why don't I?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
How're you doing?
Heard there was some excitement.
No! No... What did you have in mind...?
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Come on, Pavel...
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Cramps.
What do you think, Spock?
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
-- That's the general idea.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
We've done it before.
Spock, start your computations for time warp. Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
It'll come back to him.
What do you mean?
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
... I don't think he understands...
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
... Best shot...?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Then how.?
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
You're joking...!
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Hi... Busy?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Fundoscopic examination --
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're just -- observing.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Damage report!
Can you isolate the wave?
What's causing that!?
How long?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Team leader, this is team 2. Come in, please...
Find it?
+++$+++ Go ahead. Stun me.
+++$+++ Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
+++$+++ You play games with me and you're through
+++$+++ No, <u>my</u> name.
+++$+++ Name?
+++$+++ All right. Let's take it from the top.
+++$+++ Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
+++$+++ All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
May fortune favor the foolish. Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
+++$+++ Can you protect us?
+++$+++ "Neutralized?" How?
+++$+++ Status report, Admiral!
You sure you won't change your mind?
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
So you were at Berkeley.
I suppose they told you that...?
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
Whoever said the human race was logical? Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>. See you around the galaxy...
Why does it have to be goodbye?
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
... You have a point...
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
You need me.
Thank you. For everything. Beam me up, Scotty.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Kirk. They're gone.
But Kirk...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Right.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
You asked. Now, will you tell me something? George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Noon tomorrow...?!
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
You want the details?
That's what you think. Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
All right. The truth?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Who do you think I am?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
What's that?
What do you mean now?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Hm?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Thanks. Cheers.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
How will that be done, exactly?
You're upset about losing the whales.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Implicitly.
It's his way.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
We can't tell you. Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks. What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Go ahead.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
You've already been that. C'mon.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
I buy that. What about him?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
How soon?
Why's that?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
I will, Admiral.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will... Make a <u>guess</u>.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Right. Will you help us?
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Thank you, Spock.
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Status?
I meant --
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
The hell I can't
Exaggerate.
I cannot tell a lie.
I see.
Why not?
Yes?
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Ah... The giants.
For example?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
How do you know this...?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map. That one should do.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it. How much?
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
You've programmed that from memory...?
What are the variables...?
Surely you can be more specific...
What is our target in time?
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Thank you, Admiral.
Permission to come aboard.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
I have no control, sir!
10 seconds, sir!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Picture, please.
What is our condition?
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Warp two... three...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Mercy Hospital.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Everyone remember where we parked.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Mr. Sulu?
Systems report. Communications?
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
The explosive override -- ?
The whales...?!
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Full power, sir.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
I'll have to re-energize.
Admiral! There be whales here!
How long, Scotty?
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Mr. Sulu?
I'll try, sir. Scott out. Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Two?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Humpbacked - people.?
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott. Prepare for departure.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Yes, Admiral. Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son. David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
You will be in good hands here.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Do you have the right to murder?
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
+++$+++ Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself! The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people! We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
That's the ticket, laddie.
The keyboard... How quaint.
Hello? Computer...?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Well, that's different.
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Millions?
Old, yes. But interesting. Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Oh, here and there. I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Tell her I feel fine...
They are my friends.
Most kind, Father.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Father...?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira. Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na. Wait my son. What is your name?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na. I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I'll be here.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
This way!
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Jak'tahla?
There are caves in those mountains.
For someone so young.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
There's one thing I don't understand. In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
A perfect moment?
Will it?
An apprentice for thirty years. We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
But not you.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
Why?
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened. The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I have to go home now.
No... I want to stay with you...
Anij!
No one's ever asked me that before.
Androids... don't have...fun.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
For what purpose?
No, I mean...
Do machines ever play?
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Sometimes I do.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Really?
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Don't you ever get tired?
I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?
I understand.
I am better.
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
The artificial lifeform was right?
No.
Data doesn't breathe.
VOICE +++$+++ Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
VOICE +++$+++ Are they in any danger?
VOICE +++$+++ And our people?
Safer than leaving her here.
She's stabilizing.
Will he live?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Very funny...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
I believe it is safe, sir.
I'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation, Captain...
How many?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Incomplete, I might add.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
How about a passive radiation scan?
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
From the mission...
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
You're aboard the Enterprise.
Hello, Data...
I do not take orders from you.
It is not over.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
Another time.
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
The Ba'ku.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
A planet in Federation space...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world. I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Good luck. Dougherty out.
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
What kind of concerns?
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Thank-you for reminding me.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
May I talk to you alone?
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
Recommendations?
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
+++$+++ It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go... I've never actually seen a sunrise.
+++$+++ Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
Implants bothering you?
+++$+++ In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
+++$+++ His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
+++$+++ All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
+++$+++ I don't believe it happened that way.
+++$+++ By a Son'a weapon. There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
+++$+++ I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
+++$+++ The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
+++$+++ We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
+++$+++ They... are in opposite directions, sir...
+++$+++ Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
+++$+++ You got me, Commander.
+++$+++ I'll be in Engineering.
+++$+++ The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
+++$+++ I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
+++$+++ Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
+++$+++ I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
VOICE +++$+++ Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
+++$+++ Eject the core.
+++$+++ We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Eject the core.
On screen.
Why not?
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
We're through running from these bastards.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
Yes, we do. You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
How long 'til they reach us?
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Go back to your quarters That's an order.
Aye, sir.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
We're not going anywhere.
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Who is it?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Ask them.
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. That was three hundred and nine years ago.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Worf, you must hurry...
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Can you beam him off?
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
We have to find shelter...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Picard to Crusher...
Gorch?
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Beam him out!
Make it so.
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Captain...
Counselor?
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Say the greeting again...
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Augh.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher... Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
... I'm not sleeping well...
Both. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Or you could try lying down.
But it's comfortable.
Whatever makes you comfortable...
Come in. Hi.
No children?
Was I doing something to your neck?
What...?
Good question.
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Wine, women and song.
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Why was Data assigned?
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Initiate launch sequence.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
+++$+++ Good hunting. Hayes out.
+++$+++ The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Not yet.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
I'll be fine. He's a different story.
That'll be interesting.
He's stable... for now. But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Are you saying they won't help us?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Montana. Energize.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
At least four hours.
+++$+++ Do it.
+++$+++ Can you configure it?
+++$+++ Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
+++$+++ Vulcan?
+++$+++ And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
+++$+++ ... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
+++$+++ Isn't it better like this...?
+++$+++ I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Yes...
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
+++$+++ More lies.
+++$+++ You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
+++$+++ Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
+++$+++ They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
+++$+++ What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
+++$+++ Do you know what this is, Data?
I do not know what you are referring to.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
+++$+++ Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Contact Starfleet Command.
Where's the Sphere?
What?
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Ready quantum torpedo.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
+++$+++ I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
+++$+++ I am the Borg.
+++$+++ You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
+++$+++ But now... they are all one with the Borg.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
But how?
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
I told you, there's no --
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
We're crossing the threshold!
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
One minute to warp threshold...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
I'm on it...
<U>Engage.</U>
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Ignore it. We'll be fine. Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
What's still there?
No... the door's too thick.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Captain --
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Ready to make a little history?
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
Maybe... Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
There should be some kind of manual release...
I have the password right here.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
How serious is the damage?
Let's go.
Understood. Keep me informed.
+++$+++ Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
+++$+++ Main bus...
+++$+++ ATR setting...
+++$+++ I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
+++$+++ It'll be tight, but we should make it.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
There is no invasion...
Invasion.
What do you want?
Something wrong with that?
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Yes.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Huh.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Where are you from most recently?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
You don't sound French.
Great name. French?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. And you are?
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now.
Why?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm. I knew you weren't from around here.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
You're leaving, aren't you?
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Or...?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Friends from Cornell...
We?
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
I'd say you already have.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
What makes you say that?
What?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
I can try.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I'm very sorry.
Cochrane?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes, he is.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg.
On screen.
Aye, sir.
Onscreen.
Aye, sir.
Fire!
Go to manual.
Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?
Steady as she goes.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Aye, sir.
Fire.
No, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Yes, sir.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
We're still in Earth orbit.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Nothing.
We've lost Bridge control!
Understood!
I'll keep that in mind.
Right.
Just a little queasy...
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left...
Agreed. Options?
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
We have to cover both possibilities. We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
What?
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Hold that thought.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
I remember it made me sick.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
They're bypassing Engineering...
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Wil... Data was down there.
Someone...?
Report.
VOICE +++$+++ What the hell happened down there, Worf?
VOICE +++$+++ Worf? Is something wrong?
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
VOICE +++$+++ Riker here.
What kind of message?
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Target...
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
+++$+++ Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
+++$+++ Mr. President.
Or not to be -
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
You may need assistance, doctor...
The charge is murder.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
To be -
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen. Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Damned clever if you ask me...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
If they're even looking for us...
That cunning little Vulcan...
No way. You see this?
Don't remind me.
More than ever.
What is it with you, anyway?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment. It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen; I was frightened, really frightened.
I didn't mean this future.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Figures.
Thanks...
No!
Can you - ?
I wish I knew. Uhura?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Now there's a poser.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Retire.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
We were until your torpedoes!
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape. We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
It takes a lot of effort.
They'll respect him now...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
I am.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Well, I -
And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
For insubordination.
You were demoted...
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Spoken by you?
Are those your words?
That isn't true...!
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
I checked the data banks, yes.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
The drink WAS served...
What?
He just tried to save him!
How can I trust --
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
You feign ignorance?
I beg your pardon?
Very much.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
She's here - somewhere.
Where IS the conference?
From Starfleet?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Torpedo room--?
Just the size of my head -
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Where is Mr. Sulu?
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Klingon blood.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Shields up, Captain --?
+++$+++ Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation - Aye, sir.
Are you kidding? Send to Starfleet Command...
An INCIDENT?
+++$+++ Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
+++$+++ Aye, sir.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
I shall look forward to it.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Thank you, Captain.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
+++$+++ Kill him! He's the one!!
+++$+++ I like it here...
+++$+++ They'll be here...
+++$+++ Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
+++$+++ Give a girl a chance, Captain.
Candidate for what?
Possibly.
Where do we come in?
It IS possible.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
That's not his knee. Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
How much time's left of your sentence?
We didn't kill Gorkon.
There's a reward for your death.
Krandog aranty.
And your coat.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
This is incredible -
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Stand down your weapons.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
+++$+++ Just the prototype.
+++$+++ I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Uhura, signal our surrender.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
I hope you're happy.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
+++$+++ I always wanted to try that.
+++$+++ I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
+++$+++ We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
+++$+++ Sorry -
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
+++$+++ Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
+++$+++ Aft thrusters -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
When does this conference start?
I'm telling you. Hang on. How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Bless you, Sulu. Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Sulu!
... is to trust him.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
But we haven't run out of history just yet. Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
What's she waiting for?
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Close enough to beam down?
But I am not human. I am only -
I SHOULD have been -
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness? Would that constitute a joke?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
The night is young. Anyway, it was logical. You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
Are you dining on worms?
Why would they give them to us?
Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
The peace conference.
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
Captain...
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
From Enterprise?
Where?
Spock, I'm really tired...
What is it?
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Never been this close.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you. The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
They're dying.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
You have personally -
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Who else?
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat Enterprise surrenders --
Captain --
Channel open, Captain.
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
+++$+++ I don't want to.
An error.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
Any progress?
+++$+++ A lie?
+++$+++ Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
+++$+++ Not as yet, sir.
+++$+++ Such things have happened before, sir.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
That the universe will unfold as it should.
You must have faith.
+++$+++ Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
+++$+++ I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
We've been ordered to -
Confirmed, Captain!
No, sir.
Sir?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Praxis?
What is it?
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility. Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
+++$+++ I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
+++$+++ Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Aye, aye, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
I believe I am.
This one can.
Would they?
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
I know precisely where he'll be.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Nevertheless.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
I think not.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Maybe we should write them a letter?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
What exactly does that mean?
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Yes, sir.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
How long is that?
For how long?
No. Can I move now?
No.
I know.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Because you are dangerous.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Is that your final answer?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Can you remember our father?
Do you know where you are?
You are me.
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the “Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the “Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat…
Fuzzy face is gone.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Not tonight, I have work here.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
But we do have one advantage. He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
How long does he have?
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Is he very much like you were?
He turned out all right.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
You're working late.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
When was he... created?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
It'll serve you right.
Sir.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
We are being hailed.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
How can you be sure?
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Yes.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Ready, Captain.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
It'll only work for one of us.
It would appear so.
Aye, sir... This way.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Data!
He is very observant.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
To new worlds...
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
And this makes you "sad"?
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Sir. I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
So... To happy endings.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
You do not look like me.
Why am I looking at me?
What is our approximate distance?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
No, I do not mind.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
What purpose does this serve?
Yes.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment. The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Thank you.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The resemblance is... striking.
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
It appears to be... ... an arm.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
How can you be certain?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
And I you.
I don't believe that, sir. We’ve shared many disappointing journeys.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Do you have a moment, sir?
With pleasure, Captain.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
The least I could do for you, Deanna. Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic. To leave all of this behind and be with me.
You sick bastard!
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'm only half human.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Understood.
Do you have life support?
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Number One. You have the bridge.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Sir, we're being hailed.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. Now, Mister La Forge.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Ready, sir!
Aye, sir.
We’ve got him!
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
What's he doing?
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
Cannon fodder.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Not with the Romulans.
Understood.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.

I look forward to the sport. Take him.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
That will never happen.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
What's this?
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
We're being hailed.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
No!
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
To find the head, sir?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.
I won't do it.
Serving with you has been an honor.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
Agreed.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Report.
Strength in numbers?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Sir?
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Not very chatty.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
It's working.
Why don't they answer our hails?
A coup d'etat?
Acknowledged ... ...I'll talk to Data.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I’ll be in the gym.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I am.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
It’s too late.
That's your life... not mine.
I don't know.
Yes.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Long ago.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
You know that's not possible.
And what of the Enterprise?
Why are you here?
We are.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
All of this so you could capture me?
What are you doing?
Why am I here?
In time.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I know.
There is that.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
New worlds.
Yes.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
You don't trust me.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
What happened?
I know.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
You know I do.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Yes.
I have dissolved the Senate.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
I've never met a human woman.
No?
Praetor Shinzon?
+++$+++ But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
+++$+++ What about Picard?
+++$+++ Disruptors are off-line, sir.
+++$+++ Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
On my way.
Let's go.
We're being hailed.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Should I raise shields?
Runs in the family.
So they’ve got him up and running.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Praetor...
What?!
Seven minutes.
A matter of hours now.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
Do as I tell you!
Find her again.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Yes, Praetor.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Praetor.
Silence, Romulan!
I have a purpose.
You don't have to understand.
I came this far alone ...
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
None.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
And?
Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
I don't think so...
No, we can handle this.
Probably kids.
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
Benny, there's nothing there.
I don't see anything.
I don't want to scare them away.
We should have. Let me see.
It's still the full price.
I'll have to run your card off now.
Fill this out. Will this be cash or credit card?
Sure.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
What can I do for you folks?
Thank you.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
What do you think of America?
+++$+++ No.
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
Make any money?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
What do you do?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Where's that?
What was your last stop?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
No!!! No!!!
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Recognize this?
+++$+++ Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
What?
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
That's the chance we have to take.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
What's all this for?
Hello George.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
Oh shit!!!
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
It's taken on a disguise.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Contain it and get back to me.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Neither did I.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
It's real, George.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Mrs. Haydn...
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Marc Shermin.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
I will.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ I love you.
+++$+++ What do I do now?
Well...
+++$+++ Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
+++$+++ I will wave to you.
+++$+++ The yellow one.
+++$+++ There.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
How long will it take you to get home?
+++$+++ You want the baby to laugh at me.
I'd like to...
This is yours...
+++$+++ I will say that we can be friends.
+++$+++ Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
+++$+++ I understand.
+++$+++ This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
The cook again?
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
What for?
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
+++$+++ You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
+++$+++ It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
+++$+++ You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
+++$+++ They are beautiful.
Oh, you're pretty...
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
You don't forget anything, do you?
Good morning.
+++$+++ What?
You're damn right I am.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
+++$+++ You can stop. I will go on alone.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
No one's traveling in this weather.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
Where did you learn that?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Where are you going?
+++$+++ I don't want you to be hurt.
+++$+++ I will go. But not you.
+++$+++ If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
+++$+++ This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
+++$+++ I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
+++$+++ Are you angry at me?
+++$+++ You can have one.
+++$+++ The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
+++$+++ On the radio they say it's good.
+++$+++ But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
Yes. Sing some more.
That was beautiful.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
Do you have music up there?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Yes.
What are you doing?
It's bad.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The captain...
Yes.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You thought we were a different planet?!
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
What happened?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ Please stay.
+++$+++ Jennyhaydn.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
+++$+++ Can I have the gun?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
+++$+++ 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
+++$+++ I do not speak English.
+++$+++ But I speak English.
+++$+++ 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
No... The closest...
Eh... yes...
Yes.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ I need you.
+++$+++ Three nights... two days.
+++$+++ Yes. Day... night.
+++$+++ Yes.
How will I do this one?...
When do you have to be here?
Why are you going here? What is here?
+++$+++ I will see it next time.
+++$+++ It was yellow.
Music.
+++$+++ Horses.
+++$+++ Shit!
This stuff could kill... Be my guest.
You want to try it?
A drink.
Candy.
Yes.
+++$+++ No.
Okay.
In your pocket, please...
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ Who?
+++$+++ Shit... shit... what shit?
+++$+++ Shit?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
My... husband.
I know.
Closed.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain... But that's the only place you could be from.
Are you from up there? Space?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Not what. Who. What is for things. What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?
You'll see.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Yes. Very good.
No gas... car dead. We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
+++$+++ No gas.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
What are you doing?
Minneapolis.
Yes.
Smile.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
+++$+++ Money.
X...
+++$+++ Pancakes.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ What?
Which way?
Good.
+++$+++ Police...
+++$+++ What?!
Dashboard.
Gear shift.
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel...
Ah... no...
What?
+++$+++ Please...
+++$+++ Please.
+++$+++ Please...
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Help me!!!
Call the police!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Help me!!
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
They after you?
I don't know where he is.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Slow down, slow down.
You sure this is your car?
You get that, Lyman?
Tell him I'm not here.
Doesn't make sense.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Is it for real?
+++$+++ You have no conception of this, do you?
+++$+++ Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
+++$+++ They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
+++$+++ I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
+++$+++ Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
+++$+++ It was a man though... right?
+++$+++ It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
To the same woman?
You married, Major?
+++$+++ It was only an accident that we discovered them.
+++$+++ We better get it into the box. Come on...
+++$+++ I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
+++$+++ After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
+++$+++ No, sir. Radar.
+++$+++ We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Can you see under the faceplate?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
+++$+++ I don't understand.
+++$+++ Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
You know that's impossible!
Judy, that's stupid.
We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
I wouldn't think so.
+++$+++ Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
+++$+++ Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
+++$+++ Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
+++$+++ Is there a reward in this?
+++$+++ If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
+++$+++ I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
+++$+++ I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Just not the eyes.
Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?
It's always politics. Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now--
I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
A star is born.
Some tips. Don't dart your eyes around. Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn. And don't act natural. Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it?
Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire. You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.
Okay, let's get you wired up. I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Take her up to the suite. Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Maybe later.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Uh huh. And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.
My God.
Hey, he was going to kill you. And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I'm not. Just a little poach job.
What're you going to do?
Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening.
What a nightmare.
You think Tran killed her?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
We should talk alone.
Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out of this.
What's going on?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.
Who did it?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Can't do it.
Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. And you will.
Maybe.
He has his uses too.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
You talked to Iris? When?
You have to go. I mean it.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
No, Lenny.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Make me forget it, baby.
I don't feel anything. Is it on?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
What? Right Here?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Sounds good.
What kind of things exactly?
Clips.
Just what I've read. That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire. And now it's gone black market. So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
No.
You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I right?
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right? But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Yeah. Pretty zany, huh? All this shit caused by a random traffic stop. Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that. Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos. You gotta take what you can, while you can. Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Naawww.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
I won't say anything.
You bet. Did you like it?
That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.
You just did.
I sent her to the party. I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
I'll have that. Glock 22. Nice.
No. I suppose not. I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
What do you mean?
No. Bad idea.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Yeah. So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Smoke. Rumors. I've heard stuff about a death squad. A group a guys loyal to the hardline school. Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. I've heard stuff.
No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
He's been cooked-off
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how. Just stay close to Faith.
Looks like she was holding out.
Faith OK?
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
That's right. He wants to share. Needs an audience. This is one sick puppy.
Top ten.
So've I. Too much.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it again. And again.
Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this stuff. Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Let's work it.
You alright? Y'okay?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.
You should feel like shit.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
I'm telling ya, it's over. We used it all up--
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Thanks, Max. I'm touched by your concern.
Naw. She won't call me.
You were lucky, Max.
That's not sayin' much.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice tie.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks. And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal. You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face? Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it. Said I wouldn't want to see it. She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Iris, man. Pay attention.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me. I mean she was just here.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there? Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma This is not good. I don't like this at all...
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What else you got?
I said that? Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens. I'm snorin'.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Come on, Lenny. I got expenses. I got to get this rig fixed. Look at it...
Yeah, when did that start? Come on, man! It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways. Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. Right?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.
Sorry.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
It's alright. He means it.
Charm.
About what?
I always do.
Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an important artist.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Your existence.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Commissioner Strickland.
Nero.
See you downtown.
Yeah. We did.
Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Yeah, right. Fucked.
Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal.
I still got one ace to play. Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Alright. We're going up.
You see Tran?
Got your ticket?
Mace... you're a girl.
But she was different. There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her. See? It's not about what's in her head. It's what's in mine. I can't let go of the promise. It's... like... it's all I have left.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another lost soul.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them. Did it?
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right? Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that.
I'm not going.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland. The sanctimonious prick who busted me out. His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it. I know this guy. If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
How long does it last? Oh.
To break the trail. If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too. Our killer is running as scared as we are. Which makes him really dangerous. Judging by how scared I am.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
It was a tough call.
There's a plus side?
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year, Lenny.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Yeah I know. So what do we do?
Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?
Uh unh. I won't do it.
Tell me.
You sure?
Yeah, me neither. It was one of my favorites. Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday. I'm going to really miss it.
Fire's out, isn't it?
The gas tank's going to go any second!
It's okay, Lenny They'd never get here in time anyway.
Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do.
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
It's in my case. Okay? I'm going to open my case...
Something in your car...
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Will you relax. There's nobody back there.
What is it?
Where we going?
Whatup Lenny?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry.
How's Zander?
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?
And what about the guy that was following me?
Because it had to look random. Not connected to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
She said "If they get me". They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
No it doesn't.
See, it's all about what they see walking in. A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong. Random kill. The kind you never solve.
She came to me for help. I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
No more, Lenny.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
So that gives you something.
Never really thought about it.
Is this great fabric or what?
Uh unh. No way! They'd crucify me.
Jesus, Mace. Back off.
Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
And gives it to you.
Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Black. Jack.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just go! GO!
No idea.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
You'll see.
She's my destiny.
She still loves me.
Rams... that's football, right?
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at all? Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
You still like me, don't you? We're still buddies?
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
So am I. Just trying to get by.
I thought we were friends.
I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Get it.
In LA? Are you crazy?
Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani. You angry?
Are we having a bad night?
Coming with you.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation. We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests. I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
What's his name?
Yeah, but that was for love.
Define illegal.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are. But now the risks are outa line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar. Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife. And maybe he really does catch something--
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service. I save lives.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Mace, you're my friend. I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Just a couple of hours. It'll be fun--
Come on, Mace. This is gonna be a big night. Can't you feel it? The energy in the air? There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there. Let's go. Chop chop.
Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It's good.
Are you going to make me beg?
Just Lenny.
You really want that on your head?
Fine. Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains? The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. It'll be all- out war and you know it.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
He's skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Testa?
Besides that.
Was this him?
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
The diner?
Anybody talk to the press?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway. Anything new?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back. Is that...?
Winona.
She's buried.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
You heard?
Hi there.
Dylan here.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night. Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Let's take a look.
What does the Manager say?
Hey, Sheriff.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
What's the bad news?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
Who knows.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
That's right, Jan.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here... ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here. These burn marks.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
This is Agent Mackelway.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me. Ever handle a serial case?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not as much as you'd think.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What do you want from me?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What's wrong with me?
Not bad, huh?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
You know, you ever think about other women?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home? How does your wife feel about it?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around. Whatja sell?
Hi. What's in the case?
Put a BOLO out on that.
What kind?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
He had an orange hat on.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Yes.
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back. Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
He said it was a clue?
At the field office.
What's with the eyelids?
What about his killer?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Please.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Another what?
What?
Smarter than us.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Chuck, hello. This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I understand.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I didn't use Low's name.
I was looking for a pattern.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I was visiting an old college friend.
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante? You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
How long ago?
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
"Was?"
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
I don't believe this.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
I'll take it into consideration.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Do you think he singled you out?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
How do you feel, Agent
Its called insubordination.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
From the grave?
Who?
This better be important.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
You are so fucked up.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
Don't you touch him.
Miss me, Dave?
What happened?
How are we going to find him?
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I've got to take a piss.
I haven't changed anything. Damn.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
All the same killer?
It's quite advanced.
Yeah, of course.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer. I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it. Don't worry, I've cleared it.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
You were right. He found me.
I met with Richard Low. These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Suspect Zero.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Hello?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Not the way I can.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
What's that?
That's true.
Oh.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
You did.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso. They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Sue Ann Hanson.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies. This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
We did find these, however.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Just routine stuff.
He's called a couple times.
I've been thinking about this.
It's a no-no.
There are Agency regulations about this.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Huh?
Don't be too harsh.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Me too. Make any headway with "Zorro"?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
What's this country coming to?
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Sex.
And one other thing.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
You got a point there.
This is some serious shit.
"Gone live?"
They're all criminals?
You want to have dinner?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Don't even go there. What's up?
Relax. J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Yes I do.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
That information's being withheld from the media.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have? We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics. What did you do to piss him off?
Not especially.
Five months. I love it.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
None taken.
Thanks for the ride.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
No weapon.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me. Unhook me.
Sit back.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
Agent...
Was it Zero?
Yeah.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me. Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
You knew it was me all along?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
Zero killed them all?
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
I don't carry it with me.
So you went underground?
Suspect Zero?
What was your weakness, sir?
He's moved on to TV.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Agent Mackelway?
Who are you?
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
I want to go live with you.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
I want to help you.
Let's talk about Zero.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
If I owe, I will go.
I've been to Chicago.
Lead the way, Murman.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Perhaps you can explain it to him. It's Agent Mackelway.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
350 miles.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
I talked to him.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
The same.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Got a vehicle? Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
I screwed up twice, sir.
Sounds like fun.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
What did you do to end up here?
So you're the new meat?
Take your shirt off.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent. You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
+++$+++ Don't do it, Mike.
+++$+++ You should call your Grandmother.
+++$+++ Are you calling Her?
+++$+++ You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
+++$+++ That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
+++$+++ Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
+++$+++ Ever since I've known you.
+++$+++ You've been through worse.
+++$+++ You have to put things in perspective.
+++$+++ Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if... Skipping message. End of final message.
Nikki.
You better pay the man.
I'd say about two weeks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
What's that like?
You're a comedian?
...maybe...
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
Oh... a Cavalier.
I'm sorry?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Anything.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
What what? What advantages?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
It does.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Yeah.
Tell me about it...
How was it hard?
Just like that?
Not lately.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
I like quiche.
Like the quiche?
I'm Mike.
Hi.
...then ask where you met her...
What else is going on?
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...you might get cut out.
...not until you book it...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
Oh. You know.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
...Four days..?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
You haven't told then, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi.
Let me just check on my boy.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
The poor thing. Six years?
Oh my God.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Always...
What do you guys do?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Do you have anything smaller?
You want this in black chips.
Oh... right.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Sorry?
I understand.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Six years.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Why not?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
What do you do, Trent?
Well, who represents you back east?
Who's your booking agent?
Why not?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
No, no. Hold on.
Yeah, hold on.
Lorraine?
Hello?
...well, it suits you...
...Which one...?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...It's really getting late.
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. Can I have one of these?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
It's not going to well?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
You're a comedian?
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
I would love to see you again sometime.
Listen. I had a great time.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Goodbye. I lov...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I heard you might be moving back...
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
I miss you, Mike.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
You know, us.
Yeah.
Good. I think about things.
How are you doing?
How's it going? It's been a while...
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Wow. You wanna grab a bite?
You miss the pain?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Then why won't she call...?
I didn't make it...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Well, you're doing so well...
Well, that's dumb.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Oh boy.
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
You want to talk about it?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Thanks, man.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I got to at least try once.
There are so many beautiful women here.
Him?
Oh, like that song...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
I just tested for one...
There's the rub.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Darwinism at its best.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Bud.
Classy.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
What'd you get?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I've decided to get out there. Go ahead. Play it out.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
I didn't mention her once today.
I don't talk about her that much.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Why?
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
What do you want? You're tall.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's a gig.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
No problem.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
There's the rub.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
It sucks.
Right.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Right.
You don't call.
She's really special, guys.
Believe me, I know what that's like. Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
You live in such a fantasy world...
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
She was cute.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
Not well.
Damned if I know...
...He's derivative...
He's trying to be an actor.
So, what? Eleven?
Give me the money. I'll get it.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
It's kinda money, actually.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
You little bitch!
Don't call me ever again.
Mike?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
That's right.
Are you ready to order?
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
What the fuck..?
So, two days?
Tomorrow?
How long do I wait to call?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
What a surprise.
That doesn't matter.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
She didn't notice.
What?
Minnie Pearl.
It's on.
...It looked money.
...through the kitchen...
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
Who? Rob?
What time's this party tonight?
You guys are such assholes.
No.
No. Doesn't that suck?
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
I hear she's getting real fat.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
He drives a carriage.
Selling scrap metal.
...a day...
Don't remind me.
I just need some time...
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That was different.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Yeah, a good friend.
I don't think so.
She didn't like me, anyway.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
She was hot.
Christy was nice...
Sorry about interrupting...
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
I gotta use the phone.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
I'm telling you!
Wait... She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No!
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
What was the part?
Oh... a Dorothy.
Whatever.
I'm Mike... and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
We didn't do so bad after all.
I hope so. We gotta go soon.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
...gotta...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
I know she's coming back.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She smiled, baby.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
Mikey's the big winner.
Let's go.
Let's just leave.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Yea, how much?
Thanks for clarifying that.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
You gotta do it.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Double down.
You think they're watching?
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
We're gonna get laid, baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Did she, or did she not smile?
She smiled baby.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
Vegas.
Vegas, baby!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
What?
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Tonight, baby.
We're going to Vegas.
VEGAS.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
S'up Trent?
Our little baby's growing up...
...just be smart about it.
You don't have to wait three days...
Be smart about it.
...Definitely...
Sorry man.
It is on.
It's on.
It's on...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Anaheim...
You dick.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
You're money.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...honestly...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
That's what I keep trying to tell him. You're so money, you don't even know...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
It's on.
That was pretty cold, dude.
Yes she did.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
No.
No.
...It's on.
...How novel.
...Is he brown?
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
...against the computer.
Because he's a bitch.
Bitch... You little bitch!
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Six.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
You owe the Don a service. He has no doubt that you will repay it.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Yes, I understand. I'm listening.
What do you wish me to do?
Godfather.
Be my friend.
America has been good to me...
Then make them suffer as she suffers. How much shall I pay you.
An eye for an eye!
I ask for Justice.
+++$+++ And what is that Bonasera?
+++$+++ Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
Barzini.
Barzini is dead. So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. That little farce you played out with my sister. Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Godfather!
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Understood. I just wish I was doing more to help out.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Ba Fa Goulle.
I'm not hungry yet.
OK, OK. You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Your girl friend. She says she can't make it tonight. You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
Shut up.
We gotta move...
The gun will be there.
OK, but be careful.
You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter.
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
That's all? Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Maybe three, four times. I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no. Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
You heard about your father?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Probably all the other families will line up against us. But, it's alright. These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light. Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Sure.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
What are you, a dance judge? Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Are you worried about security for your million?
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
My compliments. I'll take care of them from my share.
Thirty per cent. In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences. Be my friend.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production. My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss. The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
It's too late. All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Sure.
He owns the studio. Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller. And the main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy. When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
+++$+++ Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace. He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune. Michael has all my confidence, as you do. For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
You mean Tattaglia.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Yes.
I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
It's from Johnny. It was announced this morning. He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.
Should I bring him in.
+++$+++ On a day like this. Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now. Write that down before you forget it. The Turk will wait.
+++$+++ When did he call?
+++$+++ And with prison record.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand. Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
You understand him better than anyone.
+++$+++ Good.
+++$+++ Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
How?
+++$+++ There are men in this world who demand to be killed. They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me." Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon. Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. I think you have done the same with this man.
+++$+++ I see you have your Luca Brasi.
+++$+++ I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Then why have I become a man like you?
You wanted me to be your son.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
No.
+++$+++ Good. When you are finished, come and talk to me. I have hopes for you.
+++$+++ And now, what do you choose to do?
+++$+++ What miracles you do for strangers.
+++$+++ And this?
+++$+++ What was this for?
+++$+++ Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
+++$+++ Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
+++$+++ You want him to stay in this country.
+++$+++ Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
+++$+++ Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino. He has been killed.
+++$+++ Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
+++$+++ The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen. Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Corleone.
I know.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Don Tommassino.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Is your wife coming with you?
Shhhhh.
Take me to America! You need a good lupara in America? You take me, I'll be the best man you got. "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
Hey America! Is she as rich as they say?
We hear. We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You tell us about America.
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Beautiful all over, eh?
I know about what you mean!
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Mike!
That's for you to find out.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
No.
You look good, too.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop had Genco, who do I have? Hey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner. Don't be sore.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. I want to get things going good before he gets better. What's the matter with you?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Jesus, I don't know...
One of Tattaglia's people?
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain. Never. It would be disastrous. All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover. So just...take that into consideration.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this. This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
We should hear what they have to say.
What about that Tattaglias? What will they do about Bruno?
Was there a definite proposal?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. You know the old man doesn't want that.
We're all tired...
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through. Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me.
Is the hospital covered?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Will you give this to him.
An accident. No one was hurt.
Nobody knows where he is. We know he's all right, but that's all.
Kay, we weren't expecting you. You should call...
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies. And I'll tell you why. He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges. For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons! Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star. I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world. Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off. She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give. But he should try me again on anything else.
A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime. Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
What about McCluskey?
No. I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Thanks Tom.
Is it true?
Tell me!
Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.
Will you?
I'm busy.
Let HER ask.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Don't you want dinner first?
Oh Michael.
Goodbye.
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
I don't think so either. I better go.
I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Look. I'll see you tonight, OK?
I can't...
Huh?
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
I love you.
How is your father?
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
I'm thinking about it.
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator. Here.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Just you.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
How do you do.
He's coming over here!
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Michael, I love you.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael...
Al Capone!
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
You like spaghetti?
You really want to know?
No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
They're talking to themselves.
Michael, what are those men doing?
I've never seen anything like it.
You've read about my father in the papers. You've seen that no one's here to guard him. Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. Believe me and help me.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
You just stand here one minute...
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father. What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
O.K. How long do you think before I can come back?
A million times.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
Go on Mike.
We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop. You have to get Sollozzo now.
Cut it out.
I won't panic.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital. I came down late. There's no one here. None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one. The old man is completely unprotected.
Send some bodyguards.
Where are you going?
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together.
Until the old man tells me different.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. We got people in the phone company. Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
One of them fingered the old man.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
I can help you out...
How's Mom?
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
What guarantees can I give you? I am the hunted one. I've missed my chance. You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Maybe.
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be. Just keep an open mind when we talk. I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny. It's impossible to talk business with him.
I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten everything out. All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Do you wish to be baptized?
And all his works?
Do you renounce Satan.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
He talked to you?
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? The two go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it. Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow. Think of your price.
You straightened my brother out?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here. I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You goddamn dagos. I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You think I scam?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out. I buy you out. You don't buy me out.
Buy me out?...
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Mike, good to see you. Got everything you want?
I think so, but I can't get close enough. There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Right. Don't say my name, just listen. Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Do you recognize my voice?
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Okay.
Yes please!
Oh, it was.
Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Shut up.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
I don't like you.
No, I like him.
Okay, darling.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. It's great. You're going to love it.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
I'll come down.
Hi Tom.
Uncanny!
What? What?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Is that good?
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Well, we ate everything without you.
You just woke up!
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
How do you do.
What evening?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Tom, I don't love you.
I love Marge.
How?
Marge and I are getting married.
Oh God, I don't think so.
Really? To Italy?
So tell me.
So cool.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Ripley's plans.
That's good.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I don't know! Why are you asking me? How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
Is Freddie here?
I thought you'd missed the train.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
What club?
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Relax.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
What does he say?
I didn't mean with you in it.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Well we certainly know that's true.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
I know. I write like a child.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?
What?
Do you ski? Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Sure. I love Venice.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
This is so good of you.
What time is it? Oh God! Do you always type your letters? That should be two Ts.
Bird!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I love jazz.
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I'm never going back!
What?
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What? What's this?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Sure.
I'm intruding.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
You know, a primer.
It's just an undercoat.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Okay. And did we know each other?
Who's this?
Marge-maintenance.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Frederico!
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Hardly.
You should watch that!
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
What about Christmas?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
I guess.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Who is it?
Hello?
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
+++$+++ Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
+++$+++ Marge has been telling us about the rings.
+++$+++ Tom.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Yes it is.
I'm well, thank you.
Mr Greenleaf.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
+++$+++ I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
+++$+++ Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Such as?
I just don't believe that!
+++$+++ San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
+++$+++ Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I'm sure we've met.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Okay.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I don't believe you.
Why? When?
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Marge? Where are you going?
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I found Dickie's rings.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Very.
Look at me what?
That's a terrific idea.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Hello Marge!
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie. Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Get on. I'll take you to him.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on?
Dickie did it.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Marge, when did you get here?
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
You were going to Venice.
Is he really not here?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Oh my God. Tom.
He hates being confronted.
How long's he staying for?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
What does that mean?
Ha. Did he say why?
Where's Dickie?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
I'll go.
Dickie!
What about Cortina?
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Are you okay?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Frances?
It's superb.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
I never said that!
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
What's going on?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you.
A hotel would've been fine. We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
This is spectacular.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
I think we sort of found each other.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said -- Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith -- God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
So -- are you travelling under R?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
You're kidding.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
What?
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Dickie, my God!
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Okay then, you're crazy.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
I'll take them both.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Randall.
As in the...?
Emily. Just kidding.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Hello.
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
Excuse me?
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Hmm. C'e questa...
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
...Tom is a mystery...
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
And don't forget. I have the key.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Why lie?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Was that Meredith?
How was it?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Hello. What are you up to?
What do you want to change about this moment?
I give up.
You try. You try talking to her.
Or I could come back.
Do you want me to stick around?
Are you okay?
Not guilty.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
He's already angry, I don't think --
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
What did he say?
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
No.
I've been backpacking.
In Rome, about three weeks ago. I knew that one.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
That's good, isn't it?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
What rumour?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
We'll be there.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
And tomorrow?
Will we see you later?
Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Ditto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up. Tomorrow then?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence. I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
You have, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in. No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
31 people.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
No!
A few days ago.
I don't remember the exact date.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Even your fiancée...?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Postmortem?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
Dickie Greenleaf?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
You like ball games?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Is there a firing range around?
Nah, this'll be fine.
How much to get a permit to carry?
How much for everything.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
I got money.
You got a .44 Magnum?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Travis?
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Hello, Betsy.
Can I call you?
What about the record?
But... Betsy...
Huh?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie? There's plenty of movies around here.
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
My God!
I mean porno movies.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
I'm leaving.
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
Damn.
But this is a porno movie.
What are you doing?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Oh. Who was that again?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
What?
It keeps ya busy.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab. I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I know. I could have picked you up.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Just people people, you know. Just people. Had a dead man once.
Yeah, well... In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I can believe that.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Thank you, Travis.
Yes?
All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I don't know...
Why?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Well, we're all working tonight.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
You want to canvass?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Is that so? But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
No, I don't think so. That's someone else.
What is it? I'm busy.
Show me how he did that again.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
With the other hand, right?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
You sure he's not Italian?
Is he Italian?
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ouch!
This is gotta be a game, right?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Just what?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Oh, Tom, please.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
That's fine.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and... ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
No, I'm serious, really...
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
One-Ball McCall?
Support my kids. Can you dig it? Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
For a fee.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
A real skunk.
And what happened?
You said that?
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. So howsit?
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Yeah.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Nah. I suppose not.
I have.
Huh?
Where.
Stick up?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
What do you mean?
You don't have to.
I sure hate to go alone...
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
You're not much with girls, are you?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
How?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
What should I do? Call the cops?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Do I look like a narc?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
He shoots dope too.
He looks like a killer.
Huh?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Pittsburgh.
Where is home?
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Can I see you again?
Well, I tried.
But that one night?
Don't you want to go?
Do you understand why I came here?
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it?
Oh, come off it, man.
I musta been stoned.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
You want to make it like this?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't remember.
No.
Why? Who are you?
That's a nice name.
What's your real name?
What's your real name?
That ain't much of a name.
What's your name?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
Well... I guess so.
Hello.
No.
Have you tried the telephone?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Why should it be grounded?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
There must be something...
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
+++$+++ Well then check back tomorrow.
+++$+++ Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another. Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
+++$+++ We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
+++$+++ You moonlightin?
+++$+++ Military record?
+++$+++ Education?
+++$+++ Age?
+++$+++ Physical? Criminal?
+++$+++ Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
+++$+++ How's your driving record?
+++$+++ You want to work uptown nights?
+++$+++ We don't need any misfits around here, son.
+++$+++ So whatja do now?
+++$+++ There's porno theatres for that.
+++$+++ So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
+++$+++ Got your license?
+++$+++ No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
MAN +++$+++ Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
MAN +++$+++ Sure.
MAN +++$+++ Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
MAN +++$+++ Is that so?
MAN +++$+++ Oh?
MAN +++$+++ Why?
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
No. Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.
Wha -- ?
I'm here to see Iris.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Hey, Sport. How are things?
I'm hip.
I'm no cop.
Shit.
I'm no cop. I want some action.
Your name Sport?
Thanks.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Neither do I, I guess.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am.
I know.
The taxi life, you mean.
It happens.
Things got ya down?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Slow.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Hey Wizard.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Okay. How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? Six years, Bill. We've lived together six years.
Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
Hey! Now there's some good news.
Could we change the subject?
Not really.
Had a close one.
Just come and get me, sir. I'm tired.
He's got a gun, sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
It's me sir.
Spit it out.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
What's that? Mason?
Yes. To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
You knew? All this time?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you. You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Partners?
I'm not a field agent, all right? So cut me a break.
The cell, Mason.
It's about time.
Find the rockets. If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Now they only have three rockets left.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Wrong.
It's all I could think of.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons. What the fuck do you think?
Wait. Where're you going?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Motor oil?
John Mason. ' Don't be shocked. I don't have much time. Please listen carefully ....
You suppose?
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside? Outside a jail?
Tell me what you really do.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
I see you got the telegram.
Tell them Pete. Tell them...
Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Did you bring along something to read?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that.
You've got everything?
You'll stand by me?
What about you, Delly?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Thanks, I like it. I think.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Hi.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
You mean, me?
... including me. Right?
Dad...
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
I think it's worse now.
That's my girl! Did you...?
How'd it go?
Dad?
Delly, shhhhhh...
I see...
What... do you remember?
It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Your dancing's very good.
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
Oh. Okay.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Exactly. And he got good.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Oh.
I don't smoke?
Have you got a cigarette?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Oh.
What?
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Were we going to get married?
Do you have the...
What was that?
We were in love... weren't we?
No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
I'm sorry.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
What did... what did I want to be?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Whoa.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
Through the door. It comes apart.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Why me?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Well... where can we go?
Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
I did? Huh!
I do?
Me too.
What.
Do you... remember me?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I'm not refuting anything.
No, sir.
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
Start with what you knew then.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
And what is the state of your memory now?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.
I... I need a drink of water.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
A statement?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.
I do.
Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke.
Well, son, you're home!
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Listen to me! The young man in there...
Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god...
Mother o'god...
Are you saying that he's...
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
The Bijou?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
No. But...
Yes.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
A super market. Huh.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
Thanks.
Good to meet you. Again.
Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?
A few.
I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
Did I what?
I'm here.
The film broke...
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
Ha!
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?
Yes?
Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry.
... Ernie.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Yes?
Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.
Oh. What... what time is it?
Who... are they?
Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
Didn't you have any help?
Why?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
We've been closed for a while.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Nine and-a-half years ago.
When did I leave?
Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it.
And... what's my name again?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
The G-man?
What.
Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
We live in a theater?
Wish I could say the same thing.
Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Call me... Ishmael?
It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before.
Here, one of mine.
I guess I did.
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
No, sir.
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. I'm sorry.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Aren't you coming?
Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big.
What's wrong?
Evening, Luke.
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
What's his rent?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Well, that's not what they think.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not any more.
Luke didn't smoke.
No thanks.
No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble.
That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
It's wrong, Leo.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
So, it is a blacklist.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Why not?
At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Exactly.
I was decorated.
Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!
What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Who the hell is this "they?"
I... I don't believe this.
+++$+++ You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
+++$+++ Luke! Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
No, I...
+++$+++ Oh dear, yes. You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense. You loved Chopin. You used to call it "heaven music." "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
+++$+++ I taught you that.
+++$+++ Nineteen-oh-nine.
+++$+++ I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
+++$+++ That's my r-r-rent.
+++$+++ T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war.
+++$+++ We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
+++$+++ Cat.
Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Is there a young Tim?
I thought you...
My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
It's about me.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
The customers? I don't know...
+++$+++ Thanks.
Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
What exactly did you hear?
You bet, honey.
Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off.
Yes. Very.
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe.
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
They all know you?
I suppose. Thanks.
Ancestors?
No. Absolutely not.
No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
My girlfriend. If she still is...
I already have.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Is anyone there?
Yes.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Do you think I should go?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
I wanted to be near Mitch. It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time. That's the first reason.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
She already has a daughter.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Because she was afraid.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
A trifle.
Different?
When was this?
What do you mean?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
I suspected as much.
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
San Francisco.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
Thank you.
No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
If you have some, I'd...
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Yes.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I was wondering...
Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
Mmm. Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Do I? No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. Or maybe a closed one. Pretty. What are they?
Yes.
Yes.
Actually, it's none of my business.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Miss Hayworth?
They haven't harmed anyone.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Mother!
Yes, I did.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Cathy!
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
I don't know yet.
Darling, of course I do!
I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
I know.
Just a little one.
Could I have a puff?
Is smoking fun?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Miss Daniels?
Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
It's Alice.
It's Alice, ain't it?
The little Brenner girl.
It's nothing.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Thank you.
Yes?
I need her exact name, you see.
Are you sure?
Yes.
The little girl's name.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Daniels.
Thank you.
Of course.
Where would I get a boat?
It's a surprise, you see.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
I see. How do I get down there?
The two kids?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
And the white house?
See them two big trees across there?
See where I'm pointing?
Right across the bay there.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yep.
Yep.
Try my best.
Morning.
+++$+++ Birds are not bad!
+++$+++ Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
+++$+++ The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
+++$+++ Impossible.
+++$+++ I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
They're back!
We'll make our own fog.
Well, you're the lawyer.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Shall I call the doctor?
What happened?
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
I started to say... inside...
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
If they are?
If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
But they'll be back.
I mean. I want to...
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
I can handle it.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Shhh. Shhh.
I'm sorry, Mitch.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
What happens when we run out of wood?
Where will we go?
When?
Maybe we ought to leave.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
When do you think they'll come?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Tell him about the party.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Yes?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
She was selling birds.
In a bird shop.
How long have you known her?
And certainly pretty.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
I'm simply quoting the law.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I don't know what good that'll do. Chickens won't eat.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Please.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Did you close the door?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
I don't mind, really.
Would you like me to go for her?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
And if you don't?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I could be that way.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died... You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone. I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
No.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
What?
What good will they do?
Then he saw.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Where's Mitch?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
He was killed last night. By birds.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that. Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years. You want some help cleaning up?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Well... Well... these birds attacked us.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Not by the thousands.
We know what it is, Al.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Well, I...
Monday?
That's all right.
Yes.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
No... wait. Hold me.
Wait here. Don't move.
The power.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
You must be exhausted.
What time is it?
When will they stop?
Santa Rosa?
Where are they heading?
Have we still got power?
Do you want to try your father again?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I keep thinking of Annie.
How long have they been gathering there?
The town looks clear.
Don't let's take any chances.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
...everything I know.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
What do you mean?
It's so damn quiet out there.
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
What it was, probably...
Take wing!
Hear, hear!
Hear!
Well, they'll go along with anything.
So they united.
Growing a beard...
Certainly, of birds.
It's an uprising.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
I think I should, don't you?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Some cream?
Do you want some mustard with this?
No, I have my things in the car.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch... what's happening?
I... I am. Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Yes.
No, tell me.
What'll it say?
What?
I'm glad you do.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Yes.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I do different things on different days.
I have several jobs.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Cheers.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
But not for me.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
Why?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Yes.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I wrote the letter.
Yes, I was lying.
No.
No.
No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Yes.
Yes, but...
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Oh. That. Rome.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Oh, yes.
His wife changed the channel.
He was watching a ball game on television.
Dinner's just about ready. We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Seven o'clock then.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
You are, aren't you?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
Yes.
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
How do you know Annie?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes?
I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
What for?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
Only violators and practical jokers.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
What kind of law?
Do you practice here?
So you're a lawyer.
What's that?
What made it...
I'll find something else. See you in court some day.
I am. Good day. Madam.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
We met in court.
Ahhh, but I know you.
Hey, wait a minute!
But how... how do you know my name?
What did you say?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Some of them are.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
No, of course not.
I understand completely, sir.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
What?
That would be just fine. Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me. No, this is a small one. Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you? Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six. Yes, a California plate. No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office? Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
Immediately. Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
How soon?
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
+++$+++ What? Oh, yes, certainly.
+++$+++ I have no idea.
+++$+++ Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Well, all right, but...
+++$+++ Oh. Oh, well, all right.
+++$+++ Yes. Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
+++$+++ Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
+++$+++ Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
+++$+++ I know. Oh, I know. I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
+++$+++ I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
+++$+++ Hello, Miss Daniels.
+++$+++ Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
+++$+++ And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
+++$+++ Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
+++$+++ I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
No one called it a war!
+++$+++ I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
To... To kill them.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
What were the crows after at the school?
These weren't a few birds.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please? Yes, I'll wait.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
+++$+++ They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
+++$+++ There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
With smoke.
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
I'm not sure, but...
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
+++$+++ ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
+++$+++ That would hardly be possible.
+++$+++ They are incapable of organized warfare!
+++$+++ We need them.
+++$+++ Birds?
Scotch, light on the water.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
I haven't finished my drink.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample -- Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
There, Master Fettes. Sooner than we had expected. A stoke of luck one might say.
But can't you give me any idea?
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
That's right. Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
+++$+++ It is a pity.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
+++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine. God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
Yes.
Of course I will.
I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I'm only a student.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there in an hour.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Where can I find him?
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Aye.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
But that's long since. Gray can't threaten him with that.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You must leave this house.
It was a woman when we put her in.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel? I've had some practice in the art.
Tosh! Fettes! It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
See that, Fettes?
What?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Don't be a fool. One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
But she must want to stand. She must want to walk.
That's the way of it, Fettes. You bring the lassie to me.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
Pulse?
Wait, Doctor -- wait! The child's fainting.
Who would believe that? And you know, someone else might recognize her. She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Believe it or not. It's best for you to pretend that you do. After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it. That makes you a party to murder.
I don't know that -- neither do you. This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I wouldn't do that, Fettes. I wouldn't report it.
We can't be sure of that.
Well --
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Yes, I suppose so.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
But you did promise.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
She came again today. She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate. She feels you are her only hope.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
But this woman -- and her son --
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
What the devil do you mean? You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Richardson is a fine student. He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes. Come along now --
Well? And are you not a good student?
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit. I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Excuse me.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes. Take a look at the child.
Come in, boy -- come in.
I wanted to see the white horse --
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I can't.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina. Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness. Do you want it that much?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk. I try to make myself used to it.
He was a nice horse.
An old acquaintance, eh?
Hear him?
Why, yes.
You'll be a good doctor. I know all about doctors.
Are you a doctor, too?
+++$+++ A doctor?
+++$+++ They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Your son, ma'am? He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
I would make you rich.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I have other means of sustenance.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
Get out of here!
I take no gifts from you.
I've ordered nothing from you.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
But what makes a thought start?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I've had some experience.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray -- -- for auld lang syne.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
Hear him? Did you ever see the lads play knife?
Toddy hates me.
It might be an interesting case.
No.
I'll not do it, Gray.
You? Why? Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I am the best man for the job.
Afraid of what?
You will not have it?
Medicine? That'll keep. Sit down.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name. Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too. But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Come, Toddy -- come. Sit down here with me.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair. The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
I come from Lisbon.
Burke them?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Yes.
I know --
I want to speak to you alone. I saw something. I heard.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose. I can do nothing for her.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
I'm not heartless, Ma'am. I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once. But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
+++$+++ But can anything be done for her?
How long ago?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
+++$+++ It comes at intervals. They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent -- much more frequent.
+++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
+++$+++ Nearly a year.
+++$+++ No, Doctor. She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Aye.
He must leave me alone.
I'll get him.
You can get out.
No great lady will ever take my place?
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
And why not? He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Was that it? Well, ok.
You're wrong.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
I'm looking for my friends.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
I hate that picture.
I think we should get some support?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Yeah. I sure will.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
Two down. Two to go.
Check and mate.
We won't.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
You killed her. I saw it.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
Think maybe knives do?
That was a fucking hollow point!
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
Wrong. Answer.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A.
You lied at my trial.
Where the fuck did you come from?
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
Fucking Zombie.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
What Scar? What fucking scar?
I was talking about you.
How can you die if you're already dead?
Nobody.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Fuck. Me.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I don't know. I found him lying there.
It's not. I can't take it.
It's what Lauren would do.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
My father.
Have to find him first.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
No. You don't.
Erin. It's not your fault.
No...
Are you ok?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
No! Why are you haunting me?
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know. This.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I told you, I knew your sister.
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
How do you know?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
And he's right over there by the way. What did you do to your face?
Yeah, no kidding.
I know her friends.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Fucking crow.
Could say that.
Good for you. You do know something.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
I know.
Shut up.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
I do. Every day.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
You killed my daughter.
I mean Lauren.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Look, can I just call a cab?
You want me to walk a straight line?
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
But you, you've had them.
What's with your friend there?
Anything wrong?
Please. Come inside.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Sweetheart...
About you.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
No.
It's not what you think.
Looks like you have them both on.
He said he'd prove it.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Watch out!
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Why are there so many?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
He'll be there at 8:30.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive. It's quite an interesting problem. Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
That can easily be arranged.
Yes -- of course.
Yes.
I assure you such power exists.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- --eliminated.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
No -- not at all.
I leave that in your hands.
That's what I came to see you about.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand. Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin. Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago. After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years. We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago. So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people-- We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society. We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see. I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
He gave these to you?
Yes, I have!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it. 'Night, darling.
What do you mean, dear?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Okay.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Why -- the light in my room went out. Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Yeah -- sure. It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
I'll say goodnight again.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Mr. Brady's a cop.
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
No -- I want to take you to the movies. Do you think they'd accept these?
Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
All right.
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Did all these people die in wars?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
What does that mean?
Well, sure I would, but -- Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Where is that?
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Are you an FBI man?
How does he explain that?
I don't believe it.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
The skeletal structure is completely normal. Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
I can judge only by what I see.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations. I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Not very good news, I'm afraid. The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night. Let me read you some of the replies. "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow." "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington." Well -- there you have it.
Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I was only hoping to make you understand.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
You know about the United Nations?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
The present situation?
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
You must have come a long way.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise. Had you been traveling long?
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Is that what you're thinking about?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
What about him?
Come on in.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
I've got a good lock on my door. And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Looks real to me.
He's not there. But look what I found in his room
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I will be in just a minute.
Hello--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
It was a wonderful day.
Well, we could--
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
I'm sorry.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
How long will I live? That no one can say.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I -- I thought you were--
Remember those words.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth. If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
At the ship.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Who?
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Yes -- Just exactly.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
It won't work.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
What time is it?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
Did you believe what he told you? I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
I want to know what he told you last night.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Oh -- hello--
Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Naturally I think so.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Jittery is the word.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
You might keep this. I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
I'd give you a very good price.
Would you like to sell it?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to G2.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up. Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
But I suppose you know the answer.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Time to activate Plan B.
You gotta drive!
We blew it, Edgar! We lost it!
Fine! Stay here!
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
He's my brother.
He's a vampire alright.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Can't stand light?
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
I don't like horror comics.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
How do you like Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
The meanest!
Maximum body-count.
You know what? You're absolutely right.
Whattaya mean?
Two down and two to go.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Good.
They're looking at us.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer. Have you taken any human victims yet?
El Vampiro.
The Prince of Darkness.
Zero.
As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
What is this, David?
Where's Star, David?!
Where is she?!
What's going' on?
I'm my own man.
Don't! Stop!
What?...
Good idea. Marko. We're hungry.
You don't have to beat me, Michael. Just try to keep up.
Star?...
That's right.
We still going?
I will, David!
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Sorry, Michael. No hard feelings, huh? Here. Try these noodles.
No. Stick around.
Yeah.
For a ride.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
We don't have one yet. And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
No, Nanook! Quiet!
What?
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin. Let's stake 'em.
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.
Chill out Edgar.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Hit the lights again.
How do you know they're not?
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom. Listen to this. From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>... 'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Bad breath? Long fingernails?
This is just our cover. We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Don't go out there! Stop him!
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
I don't want names! Just lead me to him. Where's their nest?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
Right. An' now we're having company <u>again</u>. I'll take mine to go.
Max? You men we're having company again?
Smells good. When do we eat?
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either. Not even a crack. Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared. I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Ouch, my hair...
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
I guess so. She said not to be late.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I thought we were goin' into town.
Great. I wanna get some new comics.
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that wood in there for?
Good!
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Thanks, Grandpa...
You have a T.V.?
You better not like him too much.
You like Michael.
No. Just you.
No, Laddie. It was a <u>memory</u>.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
Who, Laddie?
This is Michael.
Get out, Mom! Run!
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael. Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
We are...
Sure.
Okay?
I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him.
No. I'm up.
I'll pass.
See you later.
I'll hitch.
It's early. Why do we have to go home?
He's just a deep sleeper.
For everything.
Still mad at me?
Mom!
-- I'm not talking about Max! To hell with Max!
No, I'm not...
But, Mom...
This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Vampires, Mom! Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers! The TV stations! They'll listen to you. They'll believe you... you're a <u>mom</u>!
Must be a circuit breaker.
C'mere, Nanook.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Okay. Have you been eating pizza? You smell like garlic.
In here?
He's already gone to bed.
Sorry, Mom. It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window. I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Soon as I finish this comic. Okay?
Can we get a T.V.?
He met a girl.
Help me, Mom. Help.
You've heard this story before?
Not that poor.
Tell them to get something to eat.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move... but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Ocean air!
We're getting close...
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Max... what are you talking about?
I thought you said they needed discipline?
No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I hope so.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy. Come on. Let's give it one more try. Dinner at my house, tomorrow night. I'm cooking.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two.
It's <u>garlic</u>!! I like garlic, but...
Boy! <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Oh, right. I always gets those two confused.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Yeah. Runaways, mostly. They come from all over. Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean. Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Not impressed, are you?
You're cute, Max.
Say hello to Thorn.
-- a job.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy? We've got it all. Best selection in Santa Carla.
You've got a generous nature. I like that in a person. My name is Max.
Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend.
Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing!
Okay, Sam. Thanks.
So do I!
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Save Laddie first.
Take laddie.
You're not going anywhere... Sam...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Because I love you...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Okay.
Tonight. At the boardwalk...
Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Don't be a baby. That didn't hurt and you know it.
Okay.
Sort of. We used to come here summers when I was kid. Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Michael's great. I like Michael.
Me, too.
What do you mean?
Star.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Well... yeah. Sure.
Well, I...
I... I don't feel any differently. Do you?
Huh?...
The Marines.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
I don't know.
Just for a few days, Sam. Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What??
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What happened, Michael!?
Michael?
Piss off.
Don't bother.
No. On the phone.
No.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
No. Why?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What did <u>you</u> do last night? You look wasted.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Nowhere.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Okay. I'll flip you for it.
This room is mine.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Will you give Mom a break?
This is kind of a cool place.
What!? He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?! No fair!!
Where these tracks headed?
Dogs don't eat each other.
Let's load 'em.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Just listen.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year...
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Well, where was he? Where did he go?
What was he doing in the rec room?
That night?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing?
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
You can't let anybody leave!
Don't you understand?! That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Listen to me, Garry. Please...
Anybody sick?
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Sure. You think there's a connection?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
What you doin'?
Finish what?
We'll see...
Have you come across Fuchs?
Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Watch Clark.
I don't know who to trust.
No, you're not! I don't trust any of you!
... Can't you see...? If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it! Nothing!
Too damn dangerous.
He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Let's open it. Now...
Let's open it.
Could have been anytime. Anywhere.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
We got to burn 'em.
Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything...
Childs!!
Somebody broke in.
Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.
What?
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America. I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Was dark... find a light...
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. But...
You catch anything he was saying?
Cut him loose?
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Clark, you come on out here!!
That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?!
Childs! That a fuse?
Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Then we'll never make it.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece.
We'll see. Let's try Clark.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Then kill me.
You ain't tying me up.
What for?
We ain't buying that.
You been made, MacReady.
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
What are you doing?
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Oh, shit! Well, hang on!
What?
We got morphine, don't we.
He's gone already! Do it!
Torch them!!
What we going to do?!
Where's the other half?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Look, I'm just guessing...
Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!
Torch it over there!
What's happening?
+++$+++ Thank you.
+++$+++ Damn you, MacReady!
+++$+++ Enough, MacReady!
+++$+++ Now hold him.
Would that test have worked?
Well, who's got access to it?
+++$+++ Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.
+++$+++ All in Norwegian.
+++$+++ They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Come on, Copper.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Well, get to it.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Hold on, damn it. We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
+++$+++ Goes on like that quite awhile. What do you gentlemen make of it?
In this weather?
Nothing we can do about that.
After all this mess.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
+++$+++ A day or so ago... I guess.
+++$+++ I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
Right. Why not?
How many in their party?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
No.
Well, stick with it. I want you at it round the clock. We got to get help in here...
Well, stick to it.
You reach anybody yet?
Little over two hours.
One thousand volts. Should be enough.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma... ... we'll do you last...
Damn if I won't.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Don't let up, Childs!
What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers!
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Tie up Clark, too.
What kind of test?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
We going to make it?
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Move it, Palmer.
And that was enough?
How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time.
Oh, I got you. Not too long.
What's...
Four!
He might just wait us out.
What if it doesn't come?
Why?
Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you?
Can you think of any other tests?
Bet the last place you ever go.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Calm down and get in your position.
Screw the generator!!
Get back!!
You crazy? He might be inside already?
Forget about Childs. He's over.
Anyplace but here.
Everything that's been missing.
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
... Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, MacReady... ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here...
This storm do that?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
It's the generator I think! No power.
MacReady, that you?
Right. Half of us awake at all times.
Who else could have used that key?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
So what do you make of it?
What for?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Can't hear you.
What?!
Hear what?
When do you think it got to him?
MacReady...?
But there's nothing here.
Around here.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
But you're only a mud carrier.
No...
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that. I don't think he even got this far.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
What kind of stories?
I shouldn't have mentioned it. We can't go there.
The Hall of Books.
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
And everyone looks like us?
'Fraid so. Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Ah... no.
On the towers?
I figured that. What kind of accident?
Now how did you get hurt?
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
I should hope not... ... Alexander... Make them read my books. Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I don't understand.
I won't leave you like this.
Vox...
What can I do? Tell me what to do.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
This has to end.
This has to end.
No...
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you. You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Why did they built it?
What's it all for?
Vox?
Yes.
Yes... Thank you.
Yes. But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
This is the way in?
Oh, shut up.
Yes.
It was meant to.
It frightens you.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
What?
Last night.
I'm used to that.
Yes.
You'll live like this forever. Alone. You were meant to help. To be with people. Not like this.
Because you'll never die.
We need your help.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand. It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
I was lucky. The others weren't.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time. They used us much as your people did. Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Morlocks --
I am called Vox... ... Now you are Eloi.
An "automaton"?! Please! I'm a biomechanical organism. Well, what's left of one. What's left of all of them, actually. I am the last... ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins." T.S. Eliot. You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour. Very shy though... hiding over here...
I'm the librarian. I've always been the librarian.
I must say, you look remarkably good. You don't want a book then?
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for -- -- 800,000 years perhaps. Don't keep me in suspense. What year?
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
And why not?
But you've earned a reward for your valor. I think you should become. You'll like it here. Once you get used to the darkness.
I'm tired of running.
I know.
I'm a foolish man.
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
Now will you go?
A man can change his history.
Yes. Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi. But you should be happy for her. She won't remember the creature she was. She will... become.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool. We're breeding them for submission. Soon they will be fully domesticated.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.
I could tell them. Warm them of what's to come.
Say I just come back again?
Why would you let me go back?
What?
And who are you, Alexander? Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution? This is the world now. I am fact.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here. I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot. It's just how we live now.
They survived above. Became what they are.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
We make them see what we wish.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't. Our adaptation was too successful. We survived... we endured... for this.
As slaves.
Created?
You came underground when the world was ending above. And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Alexander.
You have my word... ... She's just a beauty.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I just love mechanical things.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
Thanks. Old Nell's my girl all right. Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
+++$+++ I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth. This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances. It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
+++$+++ Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible. The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
+++$+++ The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies. Can I tell you more?
+++$+++ I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk. VOX registration NY-114. May I help you?
+++$+++ May I help you?
Let them.
Alex... people are staring.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Heavens, look at that now!
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Not like this. Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare. And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
No, I'm fine. I'm... ... wonderful. Just walking down the street with you again.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
I want to get into the light, that's all. Please...
Shhh. Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
All right...
Darling.
Alex, what is it?
You know I can't.
Got here as soon as I could.
Your birth stone. I thought --
I know it's not a diamond but --
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Oh dammit, I love you! I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
I mean... well... affection.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
What? Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Not here... alone. May we? Please?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Sorry... I was distracted.
What?
Trust me...
Dance with me...
You're late.
This... was my home.
And this would be my study. There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Good night, David.
All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
You won't say that in a week.
That's absurd --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
I can't do that --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
You wouldn't believe me.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do. But I ask you to have faith in me. Just for a little while longer. I'm working on something now. Something... extraordinary.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now. The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story? In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger. I have to make the decision. Which door conceals Emma? And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You don't know that. You couldn't possibly. If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later. If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring. You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I live with it every minute of every day.
I care more about my life. And yours.
You know that's what it is. Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
But you won't listen. You won't see me, you won't see anyone. What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy? That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
There are some things I need to say to you. You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson. He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming. I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
It hurt me, Alex. Very much.
I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice?
Perseverance.
She's gotten into your equations.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together. When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk. They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled. At that moment -- I just knew. How did you know with Molly?
How romantic...
Nothing.
In the future, we'll be better.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex. Little grey men with little grey hats.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
You sound like my father...
Where's the challenge in that?
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination. The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Tonight's the night?
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Do you know you were humming?
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
I don't understand.
Sir...?
Thank you...
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is. Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
No!
Kalen...
Mara --
I could...
Yes... I suppose so.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Good -- it looks fine. We had quite a ride together...
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives. Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much. I thank you for that.
Is it?
Someone you loved very much.
You lost someone.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path. We're on the carriage path.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Alexander...?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
It must have been safe.
Did you have fires at night?
Learning was important?
You liked it there.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done. I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
I'm a planner. I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
And there's no shame to that. It's all the same here. Everyone has an important job to do. We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
It's always been this way here. We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I don't understand.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
The mud carriers.
And this is your "work"?
This is magnificent...
You share dreams? That's incredible.
All of you?
Yes!
Yes.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night. I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Good night, then.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
I'm going to sit with Kalen. Keep the fire burning if you can.
Is he all right?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Why not?
More than 800,000 years.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Then you can speak slowly.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you. And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
You're not from beyond the valley.
He's gone to a better place.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him. He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
His curiosity is amazing.
Is there a lot of illness?
Yes.
How long did you travel?
You're up! You must be feeling better --
+++$+++ May I get you some --
Tell him to go away --
Here?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
What's the matter with -- ? -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Do you have it?!
+++$+++ Very good. Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Because it's a new way of seeing the world! Of seeing our place in it!
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
+++$+++ Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen. I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years. I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding. Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
+++$+++ No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters. They are science. Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you. Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
+++$+++ Do they?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Imagine that.
Exactly correct, sir.
I see.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander. This is the world.
We are what we are.
This is out life, Alexander. It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
We choose to believe it.
They've gone to a better place.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help. But they don't come back.
We don't know.
I suppose so.
Of course. You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
My father has gone to a better place.
I am the oldest.
New Yorkers.
Why?
I took a different route.
No...
New Yorkers.
What are your people called?
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
And hungry, I'd say. You had such a long journey.
Yes, sir.
If I might explain, sir --
Sir, if I may --
+++$+++ My fowl have polluted the yard.
They're inside --
They're here! They're inside the house -- !
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
I want to see your home. Will you take me?
We'll see about that.
What did you do at night?
I found you. I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
How did you get hurt?
I have no doubt of that. I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it. Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
I'm glad he's gone. Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
+++$+++ No, sir.
+++$+++ I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Hello, Mrs. Watchit. You're looking in the pink.
+++$+++ We never should have done this to him...
+++$+++ But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
+++$+++ Should we be...
+++$+++ But... what about Starks?
+++$+++ [Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
+++$+++ You ok?
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
I don't understand...
How did you come to know their names?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
How?
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
How...how are you here?
[Beat] You're his son?
Who are you?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
And what does that mean?
You sure you know where to find one?
You killed him?
Yes.
And what's that?
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
That's too bad.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
Relax.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
It's not my job to believe you.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
That's too bad.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
He didn't either.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
+++$+++ Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
+++$+++ They should just be looking harder.
+++$+++ They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
+++$+++ Maybe it's not such a waste.
+++$+++ We're late.
+++$+++ No, it hasn't.
+++$+++ I can't take you out of here in your condition...
[Beat] Thank you.
This is really happening, isn't it?
+++$+++ Sure.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
+++$+++ Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
+++$+++ Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
+++$+++ No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
+++$+++ I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Why?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
I'm doing fine.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
Ok.
Ok, I guess.
I've been ok.
Then, where are you going?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
What?
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Where are we going?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
No, he didn't.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
They've got lives to be grateful for.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
What? What are you thinking?
They're not.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
How long do we have?
Why?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
I have no idea.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Do you really believe me?
What?
After I...
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
How'd he die?
I gave you my dog tags.
I looked it up.
[Beat] What?
[Beat] What?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
Well, you belong in one.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
I think I can remember what's on them.
What for?
What're those?
You're just gonna walk?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Jackie.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Our car won't start.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I don't understand.
How?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
Who told you this?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
You still don't believe me, do you?
What for?
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
You have nothing to fear, William.
Yeah.
You told me this was how it happened.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
And how do you know that?
Why not?
Why don't you help me?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
What about the world?
The future doesn't look different?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Well, what time is it?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
This has nothing to do with that.
You don't understand.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
What do you mean?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Why would we do that?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
How'd he get it?
What case?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
My God you look exactly like him.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
No. I don't want it to.
Why, what would you do?
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
You were convicted of the crime.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
And if I didn't want to come?
Becker does? Are you sure?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
So what am I supposed to do?
Why?
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
The Jacket.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
What were you talking about the other day?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Don't you go to jail for that?
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Sure.
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
You ever been to jail?
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
I'm sorry.
So you never knew your mother?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
You remember it?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Well, good for you.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
Have you always been a waitress?
You like it?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
This is pretty good. Considering...
You want a drink?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
What's this?
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, how'd you get here?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Of course you don't know.
Well, where are you from?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Go fuck yourself.
Darryl.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
'Bye, honey. I won't wait up.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night. You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
You want anything special for dinner?
Hon?
Have a good day at work today.
Hon.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that! Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
In the leg.
Honey. Nothing's impossible. You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason. Maybe he was askin' for it. Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids. I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
What?
Yes, baby?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...! And you blew it for 'em. Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them. I've got no feelin' for you. But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life. Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life. That's a sincere promise.
You know what? You're starting to irritate me.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City. He also says that at that time he met a man. He identified you through a series of mug shots. He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer. Do you know her too?
Alright! She did good! Didn't she?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Alright, Lena. Go on home. We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya? Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Who do you think did it?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive? I don't know. Let us think about that.
No!
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Hey.
Good. You wanna tell me what happened?
Yes, sir. I know.
I've been better.
I have no problem with that.
That's certainly possible.
Alright.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast. We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet. So far, we got nothin'.
Armed robber.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
This is serious, son. A man is dead.
Tell us about him.
Get a hold of yourself! You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on! Calm down! Don't make me sorry I let you come!
The women are armed, Hal. This is standard. Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
It don't matter. Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'. Nothin' at all. He already got all their money. I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype. Let's just wait it out a little longer. She said she was gonna call back. Let's just sit tight.
Oh, definitely.
My Lord.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything. We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife? Are you close with her?
Right. Where are they?
What kind of gun was it?
Don't hurt me. Harlan. Please.
Stop it! Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
It's okay. I'm married, too.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
I'm spinning.
Stop.
Oh shit.
Your name's Harlan? I got an uncle named Harlan!
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Tell me.
No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
How?
What?
You're a bank robber?
What did ya do?
What?! Parole officer? You mean you're a criminal?
J.D.! Just tell me. I know you're not some schoolboy. Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
That's lonely for you, I guess. I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
Oh. I... where's Louise?
That sounds nice.
I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Louise, is that you?
This is J.D. He's a student. We're just givin' him a ride to... to here. Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'. He's goin'. Aren't you, J.D.?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Did you get married real young?
So how come you don't have any kids?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
I always knew that.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Good answer. Same goes double for me.
Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
I don't know. It doesn't even matter anymore. I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either. But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
'Cause, Louise. I don't want to lose you. And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
So whaddya think. I mean... I could... uh... get a job. Of some kind. I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Maybe.
Alright, alright. I'm sorry.
Then what?! What, goddamnit, Louise! Where the fuck are you going? Are you just leaving for fucking ever? What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him?
Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask you one thing?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
It's me.
Hello...
Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?
That's the code word. I miss you, peaches.
Peaches.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel. The address is 1921 North East 23. It's under your name.
No, honey. I told him I was buyin' a car. What is it for?
Friend of mine, owns a club. Dickie Randall. You'd know him if you saw him. His brother was in your class. Terry.
I got it. I was afraid I'd missed you. I almost couldn't get a check cashed. It's Saturday.
Okay.
Okay. I'll call you back. In an hour. Don't tell Darryl.
Tell me now.
Can't it go to any office?
Not yet.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Do you love me?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it. Can you help me?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it. I need that money. Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back? Please, I'm desperate.
Where'd y'all go?
No, I'm out of town. I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy. Deep shit Arkansas.
I am funny. I'm real funny.
Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Front.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Is this your car?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?
You're a good friend.
Go.
Then let's not get caught.
Now what?
God! It looks like the Army!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
What in the hell is it?!
Where?!
What?!
How do you stay so positive?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
You too, sweetie, the best.
You're crazy.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
What?! What d'you think?!
Shit!
Shit!
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Yeah, right. We're not gonna get caught.
Yup.
What?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Does that mean suck my dick?
I mean really! That business with your tongue. What is that? That's disgusting!
It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
You're drivin'.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We can live in a hacienda.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Good.
You could call it that. My eyes are open.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Eeuww.
I know. I know what you mean. I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Thelma, that is not an option.
No, Thelma. I'm not gonna make any deals.
What do you mean?
Yes, Thelma?
Whatever.
I said all that?
What?
What'd I say again?
I think I've really fucked up. I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed. Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
Shit. I'm gettin' tired.
Yeah, you want it?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate. You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky. I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy. The whole car smells like it.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Ready?
Sorry!
What?
I am really sorry about this.
I told you to slow down. Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I don't know! Shit! Let's just play it by ear. He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
... in Texas... didn't it? That's what happened... Oh my God.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Just the look on his face when you... ... it's not funny.
Harlan.
What? What's not funny, Thelma!
What?
Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.
Look! Look who it is, Thelma. I'll be darned. What's he doin' way out here.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
This is so beautiful.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
I can see that.
Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God in me. What about you?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
You mean now or before?
Yeah.
I'm not suggestin' that! I'm not goin' back. No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Whaddo we do?
Now what?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
Just past Boise City.
You're right.
Why not?! What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is. Shit!
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Fill her up. There's a phone right over there.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery? No excuse for that. No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Why not?!
They don't know that! It was just you and me there. I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him! I mean, it's almost the truth!
Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?
What for?
Yeah.
They think we like it. Maybe they think it turns us on.
Litterbug.
So what's the plan, Thelma? You just gonna stay drunk?
You're disturbed.
You think you've found your calling?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Holy shit.
Okay. Shit, Thelma! What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!
What happened?
No.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Taking a shower.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend. You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about. This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
What's wrong with you?
What happened to your hair?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
I won't wait up.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are. Imagine not wanting to drag him into this. He is a lucky man.
So what are you gonna tell him?
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy. He knows how to chase and that's it. Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do. So he runs away.
Thelma kinda took to him.
He's a real piece o' work. I wish you could meet him.
That's puttin' it mildly.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Thelma! I'm not gonna talk about this! Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will! You understand?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood for company right now. Here. Take this map. I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City. I think we should stay off the interstates. We're too conspicuous.
He said "Okay, Thelma. I just wanted to know you were alright. I hope you're havin' a good time. You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time. I love you, honey."
I wish we could've brought him with us.
It's probably not a good idea.
I don't know. I won't be.
Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma. Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico. I'm going. Are you coming with me?
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico. I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass. Are you up to this? I mean, I have to know. This isn't a game. I'm in deep shit. I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
No, I didn't tell him. And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this. You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I think better when I drive.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
You're not touchin' that car.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...! Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet. Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You could help me try and figure it out! I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Why are you actin' like this?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, I don't know. I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
I'm cash poor.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop. We'll get a motel room. I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money. We're gonna need money. Thelma. How much money do you have with you?
It means shut up, Thelma.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
We have to think this through. We have to be smart. Now is not the time to panic. If we panic now, we're done for. Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us. We're still okay. Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Yes.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma! Who's gonna believe that?! We just don't live in that kind of world. Pull over!
Which part?
Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know, Thelma! I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
West. Left.
Get the car!
Get the car.
Ready when you are.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun. So let's have some!
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.
Well, just relax, will ya. You're makin' me nervous.
So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Alright... I changed my mind. I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while. I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Thelma!
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.
Well, he has never let me go. He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun. All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Whose place is this again?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
In case of what?
We don't need the lantern. The place has electricity.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Okay. I will, too.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I'll call you right back.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Say you're sorry.
You got that right.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah. I been seein' you, too.
Damn. I hate that! I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Fresno.
Grrrreat!
Hi there! You alright?
BROTHER +++$+++ Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
BROTHER +++$+++ Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
BROTHER +++$+++ S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
BROTHER +++$+++ You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
BROTHER +++$+++ Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
+++$+++ No harm, no foul?
+++$+++ This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
+++$+++ Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
+++$+++ So you admit it?
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving...
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
People get hurt that way.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Why's that?
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Hm?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Check.
Got cash.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Fuck me. Let's go home.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Shoot.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
No You mean...?
Huh? But why did Healy?
What?
Amen to that.
Never met him.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health... I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
What's so funny?
Well... at least now you know.
Hey, look on the bright side --
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
You're kidding? What did they say?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Why not?
Well why don't you look her up?
I mean since then.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Mary again.
Never?
Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Good-looking?
What's he like?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Yeah, but he was successful.
He implied it.
+++$+++ I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
+++$+++ From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
+++$+++ Who?
+++$+++ Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
+++$+++ Uh-huh. Where was he?
+++$+++ So... I see you made the news.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
+++$+++ Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
+++$+++ Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Who?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
No, thanks. Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
You got a brew?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals... ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
'That right?
Call you back.
You said it, mister. I gotta go.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did. I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Oh yeah.
The sawbones?
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Here, just have one of these then.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Very nice.
Stalker, huh?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Here's the info you asked for.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Sure.
Are you okay?
Urrggghh...
How's my stomach taste, she says. Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
All set.
Turn it up, Magda.
Fuck!!
Come on, what were you going to say?
What?
Well, I'll see ya.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
-- Love story of our time.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Lint?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
How about -- ?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Here you go. What's that smell?
Great.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
That sounds like fun.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
-- He's in a cage?!
No, I mean
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
I beg your pardon?
What's that?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
Some buildings I'm working on.
It's right there on your golf bag.
I already know it, Mary.
Pat Healy.
Same here again.
Thanks.
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Your turn?
You're a sick man, you know that?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
Turn her over to a stalker.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
What do you mean 'why'?
Surprised?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Good good.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Four kids, three different guys.
Nope. Never been.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
No, not at all.
So she hasn't changed?
So you found Mary?
Really? Very, very?
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
You can't be serious.
No.
No.
You don't buy what?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Well, I know you're busy...
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Uh-huh.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
What?
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
Ho-ly shit.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
How many is that?
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Nice.
How'd you manage that one?
And you met Mary how?
Bullshit!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
What do you mean?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Who?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Among others.
You bet.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this: Seven-Minute Abs.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Oh. Well I am.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Thanks for picking me up.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
I can live with those reflections.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Where's Puffy?
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Puffy, get over here.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday. I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Bundt cake?
Sure. Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Come on, Magda It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
He's no Steve Young.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Meaning?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Have you been up all night again?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights. After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Mary, the man's a killer.
I think you'd better sit down.
What's up?
Can I pour you one?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
